# Summarization Model

## Overview

This project focuses on building a **Text Summarization Model** to generate concise summaries from longer pieces of text. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and pre-trained transformer models to deliver accurate and meaningful summaries.

## Features of the Project

- **Abstractive Summarization:** Generates new sentences and phrases, maintaining the meaning of the original text.
- **Extractive Summarization (Optional):** Extracts key sentences directly from the text.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Utilizes transformer-based models like **BART**, **T5**, or **Pegasus** for state-of-the-art results.
- **Custom Fine-Tuning:** Supports fine-tuning for domain-specific datasets.
- **Deployment Ready:** Easily deployable using frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.

## Dataset

### Example Datasets:
- **CNN/DailyMail:** News articles and summaries.
- **XSum:** Extreme summarization dataset for abstractive summaries.
- **Custom Dataset:** You can fine-tune the model with your own domain-specific data.

### Data Requirements:
- Input: Long text (e.g., articles, essays, reports).
- Output: Corresponding summaries (short and concise).
