"July 29, 2005",10,Dog food,"The wife and myself had the displeasure of visiting here last Sunday night. It was absolutely appalling - the lasagne was undercooked and was one big lump of soggy cheese and frozen vegetables. The pizza was burnt on the bottom and soft on top.  When we complained to the waiter he just shrugged his shoulders like he got comments like this all the time. We left without even finishing a quarter of what we had ordered and when we looked around the other tables, most customers were doing exactly the same.  In the front, there's a framed photo of a car that once crashed through the wall of the restaurant. The manager said its brakes had failed - but we both reckon the driver was just expressing his opinion of this terrible restaurant.  One to avoid."
"July 26, 2005",10,Poor Imitation of Italian Food,"I'll be the first to tell the truth. I had to check out this restaurant after reading some rave reviews on the internet. What a hoax. It was not Italian food. The spaghetti was one big soggy mess with a tomato sauce that tasted like it came out of an old can. Vito's pizza was below average. DiGiorno's frozen pizza outranks theirs anyday.  The place was crowded and noisy; reminiscent of a fast food joint. Service was poor; lunch took over two hours! Since the food wasn't edible, we left hungry. We immediately went to another restaurant in Union Square to have a real meal.  Don't let the friendly name fool you. If you value good food, then just pass this place and don't look back."
"May 1, 2005",50,"Nice pizza, nice pasta, nice salads","We ate here on previous trip to San Francisco and enjoyed it so much we decided to visit again. Nothing much had changed the food was as we remembered it (always a good sign) and the staff were helpful.  We also had take-away on a couuple of occasions when we were too tired from sightseeing to eat out, no change in the quality of the food.  If you are in the neighbourhood and feel like some Italian fare it is worth a visit.  Sitting upstairs you can eat and watch the cable cars go by on Powell Street."
