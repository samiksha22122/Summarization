The service was fast and friendly. We weren’t very hungry so ordered a margharitta pizza to share. The crust was crisp and delicious, the sauce and mozzarella very good. We had a glass of wine, a soft drink and two dishes of gelato. When the bill came I thought there was a mistake as the total was low. I looked over the bill and saw that the pizza was only $5. I couldn’t believe it."
"October 20, 2019",50,Superb as always..,"Visited twice when back in NYC in August. Will always be a favourite of mine and although I tried some new pizza places when we were over, Keste will always be the best for quality and it's relaxed service. $5 Pizza Popolare was good for the kids, I tried 'The Butcher' this time and that was great.

"February 11, 2016",50,Simply the best Neapolitan pizza,"Almost impossible to find true Napoli pizza in the world but Keste delivers. Just burnt enough round the thick edge, getting thinner and thinner until you hit the soupy thin middle. Extraordinary. Went at lunchtime, cramped, busy and cosy. Top notch."
