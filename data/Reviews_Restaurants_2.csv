"July 20, 2020",50,Good old fashioned Italian pizza,"More like a Roman pizza then a Napoli pizza, good crispy base, definitely leaves you wanting more slices. Just accept if you are going to NYC and you like pizza, you are gaining weight, and there‚Äôs no shame in multi pizza days."
"June 3, 2020",50,Friend,I friend showed me this pizza and I loved it. They are very good pizza makers. I have only ordered but I'm sure that they have good service as well.
"May 25, 2020",50,Great Traditional Pizza,"Spoke with Hotel about places to see in New York a this was a recommended place to visit, well worth the 30 min wait. Sat upstairs, service was great and quick, Pizza was Bellissimo !"
"March 26, 2020",20,ALMOST THERE,"Forget this place. 75feet away is Juliana's, easily the best in Bklyn. This is the original Patsy Grimaldi."

"March 10, 2020",20,Dirty and shabby,"It was not the experience we had hoped for. Several dishes and drinks on the menu could not be provided by the restaurant. The restaurant room and not least the toilets were worn, dirty and shabby."
"March 9, 2020",30,OK Not Place Would Return,"Lots of hype but mediocre pies. Watery sauce and limp crust. Ordered extra basil and received 4 leaves. Crowded, noisy and neutral atmosphere."
"March 9, 2020",40,Good pizza,"I thought slightly pricey but good pizza. My Italian friend doesn‚Äôt agree and you can get a fantastic pizza in Italy for 5-10 euros. NY isn‚Äôt cheap, we paid like 25 dollars for their smallest pizza."

"January 24, 2020",50,Great brick oven pizza as good as Patsys,unique place. great date place. The pizza doesn't taste like your typical pizza parlor. It has a unique taste.
"January 21, 2020",40,Oldest pizza restaurant in New York.,"I've been told this is the oldest pizza restaurant in New York. It surely is a busy restaurant, we had to wait 30 mins before being seated. Pizza is good. Not the best I even had."
"January 15, 2020",30,Scaffolding,We were hoping to get a pizza here mid morning but they were unfortunately not open yet. There is scaffolding around the shop at the moment.

"October 30, 2019",30,Good but best in NYC? Hardly.,The pizza was good but nothing else. No credit cards. Really? And no wine/beer. Really? Fine if you happen to be in the neighborhood (which I was). Otherwise - do something else.
"October 30, 2019",40,Great DUMBO Pizza,Wonderful pizza at a NYC icon. Friendly staff and plenty of space to sit and eat. Queues were longish but we only waited 10 mins.
"October 26, 2019",40,Good pizza,"Very good pizza, but was a it disappointed with everything else, No licence so can't have a beer with your pizza,,,, Massive pizzas and well presented,,, Beware you have to queue most days for a table,,,, Our teenagers loved it,,,üëç"

"October 11, 2019",30,"Landmark tourist thing to do, check.",I can now say I've tried it. It was good average pizza. Service was so so and we didn't have to wait long. Overall not bad but don't understand the continued hype. Other pizza places are just as good.
"October 11, 2019",20,Cannot understand the high rating,"Pizza was good, but not outstanding. Definitely not the best we had in NY and surroundings. The rule that they only accept cash is not appropriate nowadays"

"October 2, 2019",40,Very Tasty Pizza!,"Huge pizza! More than enough for two people to share in my opinion. Nice vibe in the place, and was very busy, so get there early!"
"September 9, 2019",50,Grimaldi's,Pizza lovers. This place is one of the best. Great food and staff. Very clean. I recommend all year round
"September 7, 2019",40,Place where locals line up to eat pizza,We went on a Friday and order Pizza with few toppings. The crust was thin and charred a little just like how pizza should be. The sauce and ingredients seemed to be made from scratch. It has 3 levels and close to the Brooklyn bridge.
"August 25, 2019",50,Wonderful Pizza in Coney Island,Hard to say which best this or Lomardis but wonderful pizza. Efficient service and cheap. Was a great break from the craziness of Coney Island. Would recommend it 10 times over. Quick and no fuss. Love it

"August 18, 2019",20,Forget about it!,"Was the third time w've been there. Horreful experience. Cold and rude staff. Plastic plates, knives and forks. Can you believe this? No Italian atmosphere at all. Becomes a complete bluff. Forget about it!!"
"August 14, 2019",50,Delicious Pizza's!!!,Had delicious Pizza's at Grimaldi's after arriving to Dumbo on the NYC river ferry only $2.75 well worth it. Waited in queue for 10/15 minutes pizza was delicious and would return again there huge
"August 9, 2019",40,Late Pizza,"After a delayed flight into NY found this restaurant close to our hotel and were not disappointed. Excellent pizza and good service, loved the atmosphere."
"July 28, 2019",20,Basic at best,Not sure why this place is even recommended. Pizza is basic. Paper plates and plastic forks. No alcohol served when we were there because of construction. That was quite bizarre. Line to get in by the time we left. Don‚Äôt bother with this place!
"July 25, 2019",20,Commodization,"Why this place is still standing is a mystery. Paper plates, plastic flatware and marginal pizza. Don‚Äôt bother."
"July 24, 2019",20,TOo thin,Pizza totally what I'm into pizza was tOooo thin and not as I expected I love a hearty thick pizza did6think brick oven ment paper thin and not tasty very dissatisfied and disappointed
"June 21, 2019",50,Delicious!,Definitely worth a try! The atmosphere was nice and the pizza was amazing! Highly recommend. Not too pricey either.
"June 17, 2019",30,Too much hype,Average pizza. I‚Äôm a Native New Yorker 3 generations. I should have known better. ‚Äú that‚Äôs the truth Ruth‚Äù
"June 8, 2019",30,Meh,"It was OK. Long queue, expected super amazing pizza. It was ok, but just that. Also, super hot inside, paper plates and plastic cutlery. Staff was really friendly though"

"June 7, 2019",30,Ok,"I expected the best pizza I could have from all the great reviews‚Äîand while it was good, it wasn‚Äôt memorable‚Äîhave had better in Chattanooga!"
"June 3, 2019",50,Simply fabulous!,We walked over an hour in thunder and rain to get to this place and oh boy was this the best pizza ever! We‚Äôre food snobs and not many pizzas make the mark. I‚Äôve never tasted a pizza as good as this.
"June 2, 2019",50,Great pizza,"Huge pizza, too much for one, so I took the rest home with me. Delicious and great choices. The cherry soda was amazing"

"May 6, 2019",50,"Excellent Pizza, great environment","It takes a while to get there. Also, it takes a while again, to be seated. But, at the end, it wort all the hassle. Super pizzas, service is good, and the environment is very nice."

"May 1, 2019",10,Accused us of stealing!!!,I will NEVER eat at this place again. They accused 2 people in our party of leaving without paying our bill. They all stood around and looked stupid then found our ticket which was paid in full plus a $10 TIP!! NEVER AGAIN!
"April 28, 2019",30,Worth a visit,We queued for approx half an hour and ordered our pizza but unfortunately when it arrived it had the wrong toppings. They apologised and the correct pizza soon arrived. Great pizza - would have preferred not to have plastic cutlery but overall worth a visit.
"April 14, 2019",50,Perfect Lunch Spot,"Great food, great price. Try to make it here if possible on your visit to NYC, you will be glad you did."
"April 12, 2019",30,"Good location in a histric building, but...","...our pizza was overlooked and they use paper dishes and plastic cutlery. Prices are a little to high for what is delivered. On the positive side, the service is ok and the location is good for bridge and riverbank walkers."
"April 3, 2019",50,Phenomenal,"The service was an amazing, friendly, family-like atmosphere, just awesome. GREAT PIZZA!!! The crust was nice and thin and the cheese was delicious, oh and not to mention some of the best sauce!"
"March 31, 2019",40,Good Pizza,"Today I visited the Coney Island Brooklyn location. Service was good, the pizza is very good. The only issues were ‚Äú cash only‚Äù and parking is impossible. However with everything said and done, a nice place for lunch or dinner."
"March 28, 2019",10,Ummmm?,Ummm? Went to Brooklyn just for this iconic pizza. Was not open. Very disappointing and should be more clear on web.
"March 27, 2019",10,Bad pizza!,We had a pizza with mozzarella and it tasted like plastic. Everything is plastic! It is cheap but not a good pizza.
"March 21, 2019",10,Said it was open on Google,"It was closed , Google said open came to Brooklyn just for this , but next door is great pizza , update your Google account"
"February 4, 2019",30,Not as good as it was,"Sad to say , I used to love this place but now it is no longer as good! It doesn‚Äôt seem authentic anymore. The taste is different and it seems to be more of a tourist trap than the old authentic Brooklyn pizza."
"January 10, 2019",40,"If you're in the area and there is a short to no wait, go. I wouldn't travel to far for this...","If you can get in without a queue its worth it. If i had to wait, would likely have been disappointing. I like it, quick dirty, albeit not particularly environmentally friendly and honest, but again, i didn't have to wait."
"January 6, 2019",30,"Great pizza, but you have to deal with the staff to get it","Really enjoyed the pizza, the coal fire really gives it a great flavor. Unfortunately, the staff is clearly busy and unwelcoming. We didn't feel like valued customers rather like an annoyance that we were patronizing their restaurant."
"January 4, 2019",50,Best Pizza!,Grimaldi‚Äôs is a must if you‚Äôre in Brooklyn area. It was perfect location for lunch before walking over the Brooklyn Bridge. Pizza is amazing! Best we had in NYC. Good prices and service. It is cash only. Highly recommend!
"January 2, 2019",50,Excellent food,We loved the pizza ! We waited in the line for them to open about 20 min ! It was worth it ! I recommended 100% .
"December 23, 2018",50,#1 Pizza Joint in Brooklyn!,"The absolute best, hands down...or up!! The sauce, dough, meats (if you're a carnivore), veggies...whatever you get it's all good! Go alone or with friends and family! Unfortunately they don't sell by slice. :("
"December 23, 2018",50,Perfectly Imperfect,I say that bevaus yes this places is C R O W DED! Lol HOWEVER it‚Äôs one of very few places where it‚Äôs ok
"December 11, 2018",50,Had to have Grimaldi‚Äôs,Last place on bucket list for trip to NY proved to be Oscar worthy! White pizza - add the ricotta for the best dance in your mouth ever! Fun service staff even though renovations were obvious. I‚Äôll be back
"December 6, 2018",50,Still the best,"Not a better pizza has been had by this pizza monger. I always say if I had to eat a single meal for the rest of my life I would pick pizza, but I should amend that to be Grimaldi's pizza."
"December 4, 2018",50,Good pizza,"This place was recommended to us, the food was good, pizza came out very fast, no alcohol licence though. Also bring cash."
"November 20, 2018",30,Overrated,The line is enormous given the hype as the best pizza in New York..... it‚Äôs good but not that good... cash only too a tourist haunt there are better places for a pizza

"November 6, 2018",50,Best Pizza Ever,Big tourist place so try not to go on weekends or holidays. The best time to go with little or lines are when its raining. We order several different pies and they were all very good. Top quality ingredients and the staff were very friendly.
"November 2, 2018",50,Great pizza,"We visited Grimaldis during our family trip to NYC. It was awesome pizza, we got there for an early lunch so we didn‚Äôt have to wait. Highly recommended."

"October 26, 2018",40,An authentic Brooklyn experience,Typical NY-style thin crust with lots of Mozzarella on top. We just ordered it to go and ate it outside on one of the many tables on that street. Not too expensive if you don't add too many toppings. Cash only!
"October 26, 2018",50,Pizza,Excellent pizzeria - great pizzas and friendly staff. You cannot book so either go early or prepare to queue- they only take cash but have a cash machine. Well worth walking over the Brooklyn bridge for a meal.
"October 22, 2018",50,NYC 2k18,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this pizza! After eating here I don‚Äôt know the need for Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or even it‚Äôs rival Juliana‚Äôs. It was great!"
"October 19, 2018",40,Nice pizza,Had the standard Margherita Neapolitan style. It‚Äôs significantly better than what you can get in Manhattan and not too pricey. but I wouldn‚Äôt queue for it which you have to do if you‚Äôre coming during lunch time. Come early to avoid the queues.
"October 14, 2018",20,Brooklyn Pizza,"By most standards, Grimaldi's would be considered a great restaurany, but this is Brooklyn. I'm not impressed. I don't go there any more."
"October 8, 2018",20,Ok pizza,"Pizza was good, lot of hype with this place. Service absolutely minimal, to be honest zero. The drinks all sodas .pizza was nothing special and cash only payment. Not worthy of the hype. Not worthy of going again!"
"October 3, 2018",40,Tourist Attraction,"This is simply a tourist attraction. You may think it is the ""Original"" Italian pizza in Brooklyn, but no. The line is long and the pizza is over rated. If you are looking for an amazing pizza place in Brooklyn, I would recommend Luzzo's Pizzeria."
"October 1, 2018",40,"Yummy, but a LOOOOONG line.","When you have to wait in line for over an hour for a pie, it better be good. And it was. But now that I've experienced it once, I don't think I will wait in line again."

"September 25, 2018",50,Up there with New York‚Äôs best,Loved my lunch here the pizza was delicious. My only issue was the plastic cutlery and paper plates. The food the main star was perfect.
"September 23, 2018",50,Best pizza ever,Worth the hype. Incredible pie. The lines are long but they‚Äôre definitely worth it! We did take out and sat in the park underneath the Brooklyn Bridge.
"September 19, 2018",40,Good Pizza,"Good Pizza. Cash only. The location that walking distance to the waterside. Give an ""old time New York Pizzeria"" feel."
"September 13, 2018",40,"Excellent pizza, mediocre service","The pizza is worth the wait (there must always be a queue). Tips are automatically added to the bill, so servers do not need to (hence they don't) go the extra mile."
"September 4, 2018",50,Best Pizza I've ever had,"Meal was fantastic, thin base with minimal ingredients, add more of the ingredients you want for only a small price. Atmosphere was great. 2 levels, not too noisy, football playing on big TV screens. No alcohol, but soft drinks available. Price is fair."

"August 20, 2018",50,Delicious,Took a while to find from the end of Brooklyn bridge. Worth the trip. Cash only. Pizza for 3-4 with pepperoni and meatballs was delicious. Light crispy and good price. No long line at 2.30pm so late lunch was great time to go
"August 20, 2018",50,Worth the line,"My son really wanted to go here so we waited in a pretty long line. The wait was worth it. They make a great pizza, with the best pepperoni I have ever tasted. Just remember to bring cash"
"August 19, 2018",50,Amazing pizza,"Because that thing, there‚Äôs a reason there is a line down the street for the spot. The pizza is so damn good"
"August 12, 2018",50,Worth the wait,Deliciously crisp but chewy base. Great value for money. Prompt service. Get there early to avoid queues.
"August 12, 2018",40,Iconic place,I came here with HUGE expectations but unfortunately those expectations were not met. Pizza was ok but I have had better in NY. Could be a personal choice so go walk the Brooklyn bridge and go to Grimaldi‚Äôs just to say you‚Äôve been.

"July 21, 2018",40,Nice pizza‚Äôs,Good quality and very fast service. Although the restaurant is a bit basic the atmosphere is pleasant.
"July 20, 2018",40,Nice Classic Pizza...,"If you are in Dumbo (Brooklyn under the Bridge) and need pizza, Grimaldi is your place. Classic nice pizza with some Toppings you can choose. They don‚Äôt accept credit cards (cash only) and they don‚Äôt serve alcohol but they serve a Fantastic Pizza!."
"July 13, 2018",20,"Okay, but not worth the wait","The wait is horrendous and takes at least 45 minutes to get a seat, as its such a touristy location. The pizza is good. However there is no card accepted, and the bank machine costs money to withdraw, so make sure your carrying cash."
"July 11, 2018",40,Very tasty pizza,Nice place and tasty pizza BUT Long que and one of the waiters was a little bit rude to women clients and I didn't like his service.

"June 24, 2018",50,Brooklyn experience. Cash only.,"Be prepared for a wait, so, get there early. Brick oven Neapolitan pizza. Do not expect to get one slice, they only sell whole pies. Also, do not expect to have any toppings, they only offer cheese."
"June 22, 2018",50,Very cool Brooklyn experience,"The pizza is delicious, you select your own toppings, the prices are great and the drinks list is interesting. This is a thin crust sort of Neapolitan pizza and all the ingredients tasted wonderful."
"June 19, 2018",50,Very good Pizza!,"Notice how I capitalized the ""P"" in pizza for the title.. thats how good it was! The only thing I didnt like is that they do not accept cards, but they have an ATM there so that was convinient."
"June 18, 2018",30,I found it average despite all the hype,Our family friends recommended this and told us lots of good things abt the place but we found it ok. I prefer other pizza places around.
"June 16, 2018",50,Best pizza in NYC,"The chefs make the pizza with pride and taste absolutely fantastic. One pizza is big enough for 2-3 people. Its in my opinion, the best pizza throughout NYC."

"May 14, 2018",40,Classic Pizza,"I‚Äôve never been able to sit down at Grimaldi‚Äôs: it‚Äôs always full of people. But that was not a problem to order a pizza and eat on the street or the hotel. Even American pizza is not my favorite, this is very good!"

"May 7, 2018",30,The real deal is the other line... beware,"Pizza is good, but nothing special. They need to improve. I understand the place changed ownership. Decent neighborhood pizza, that's it."
"April 26, 2018",50,GREAT RESTAURANT,Visited after the our visit to DUMBO. GREAT restaurant with great pizza. Enjoyed our stop off for lunch while at DUMBO.
"April 25, 2018",50,Excellent pizza,One of the finest New York pizzas. The place has cool atmosphere and it‚Äôs very accessible price wise. Both locations - Brooklin and 6th Avenue are worth recommending.
"April 23, 2018",40,Great food but no alcohol,"Food here was amazing, huge and incredible value. Shame there was no alcohol but apparently licence is pending. Also no WiFi, which would have been nice"
"April 20, 2018",50,Brooklyn Pizza at it's best,"Coal fired pizza, thin crust, fresh mozzarella. Great pizza. Yes, there's a line, but it goes fast. So the menu is antipasta, pizza, soda, coffee, espresso, and a few desserts. No beer or wine. CASH ONLY!"
"April 18, 2018",20,Disappointed,"Pizza was burned. Crust very hard. Very light on the toppings. No beer or wine, they don‚Äôt have a liquor license. Minimal service. I will not go back or recommend to a friend."
"April 15, 2018",50,yummy!,"Fun to take your touristy visitors! Walk across the bridge, eat, then walk it off. Oh I loved the pizza."
"April 15, 2018",50,Great after walking across the bridge,It was worth the walk across the Brooklyn bridge. Meatball pizza was the best. And walking back across the bridge after sunset is the best way to digest anything ever.
"April 13, 2018",50,Just across the Brooklyn Bridge,"Do yourself the favour - walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, soak in the sites and then sit down for a truly great New York style pizza at Grimaldi‚Äôs in Brooklyn."
"April 9, 2018",50,THINK THIN,GREAT think crusted pizza with the freshest ingredients.....The best pizza in NY no need to wipe the oil off the top of the pizza...the cheeses are fresh and excellent
"April 8, 2018",50,great pizza,The best pizza in NYC! The classic margarita is so good!! Neat old building with a cool history too.
"March 29, 2018",20,Tourist trap. Mediocre pizzas,Went here after walking the Brooklyn bridge. Someone had recommended the place for good pizza and the long waiting line outside indicated that it might be true. We were however very disappointed. Pizzas were bad and expensive. I don‚Äôt understand the hype.
"March 27, 2018",40,Nice italian New York pizza,We only had to wait for 10 minutes to get a table. We had a large pizza with 2 different toppings. No creditcards only cash
"March 23, 2018",50,Superb,"We had a great pizza at Grimaldi's pizza. We had to queue a couple of mintues outside, but that's normal in NY. :-) It a bit unusual to have the pizza served on disposable dish with disposable cutlery, but still the pizza was good."
"March 21, 2018",30,Guided Tour as guide,Way below expectation considering the reputation. The pizza was average at best. I won‚Äôt be taking my clients there in the future.
"March 18, 2018",50,Superb,"If you want a fresh pizza pie that leaves nothing to be desired, then this is your place. When you arrive, don't be turned off by the long line outside because it moves pretty quickly. Always my go to for a delicious pie!"
"March 17, 2018",40,"Tasty pizza, cash only",You‚Äôll have to queue for at least 20 mins and it‚Äôs bizarrely cash only - and doesn‚Äôt have a liquor license - but the pizza is really really good. Service is no frills. Would go again.
"March 14, 2018",40,"Cash only, great pizza, unpretentious service","The pizza was excellent. The deco is fine, the ambiente also. The service was no nonsense although be prepared it's cash only"
"March 12, 2018",10,Meh,"This was a disappointing experience. Bland pizza, paper plates, water out of plastic for a 27$ pizza. Inattentive wait staff. Go somewhere else."
"March 8, 2018",20,Unfortunately underwhelming,"For the price, what we got was far below expectation. The small pizza was undercooked, fairly bland and the bill was $45."
"March 6, 2018",50,Lovely Pizza,Very busy place and I can see why the Pizza is Delicious. Salads are huge definitely a place to share .Well worth a visit
"March 3, 2018",50,Pizza fans,This pizzeria gets very busy and if you dont mind making a line you should try it. Yes its all that amazing! We took an extra pie home. To avoid lines order by phone & pick up to go.
"March 3, 2018",50,Still best in NYC,"Growing up in New York this place was famous for pizza, and although now more of a tourist stop, it's still fantastic. And the canolies are pretty darn good too! Be advised, the small pizza will feed 2 adults easy with left over."
"February 27, 2018",50,Yummy huge pizza,‚ÄúSmall‚Äù pizza 6 verylarge slices for Mum and I! We found it very tasty ! Busy ! Friendly staff Paper plates and cutlery.
"February 21, 2018",40,Part of Short Visit,They serve good Italian foods but we only ordered pizza if I remembered it correctly it was medium plate. A good portion slice for 4. For pizza cravers might be for 2. üòä
"February 17, 2018",50,Delish,"My first New York meal did not disappoint! The Margherita pizza was divine, with a lovely, crispy crust. Go for dinner and walk back to Manhattan on the Brooklyn Bridge just blocks away. Perfect way to start our trip!"
"February 11, 2018",30,Overhyped,Really disappointed after the hype. The pizzas are tasty and huge however the flavors could be better e.g. the tomato sauce on the base tasted like watery chopped tomatoes. There are better pizzas elsewhere I am sorry to say.
"February 11, 2018",50,Great NY Pizza,What can I say that others haven't. Simply great pizza! They don't take credit cards so make sure you have cash to pay
"February 9, 2018",30,Good pizza,"The pizza was good but maybe over-rated. I was expecting fabulous. We did all like it, but not enough to make us not want to try other pizza places."
"February 9, 2018",50,Delicious,"We had, of course heard about Grimaldis world famous pizza and couldn't wait to try it. We were not disappointed at all. We were also expecting a wait but were excited to be seated right away. The pizza was so amazing."
"February 9, 2018",50,Great Pizza - Good Price,"We loved our Pizza and we love the price, there really isn't anything more to say. It tasted so good, never thought we finished the large pizza for 2, but we did. Would recommend."
"February 8, 2018",50,Great place,"Great place and great food... i used to like lombardi before till i tried grimaldis... they also let you see how they cook their pizza in the oven, which is great, the service is extremely friendly but it is a bit pricey for a pizza"
"February 3, 2018",10,Rude and cash only,"Very poor service and cash only. The ATM in the restaurant charges $4. While there, I found out that the Grimaldi family actually owns Juliana's which is right next door. Went there too and had a great experience. Grimaldi's Brooklyn was a serious disappointment."
"February 1, 2018",50,Best pizza I've ever eaten!!!,"You may have to queue, but it's worth the wait! We ordered a large pepperoni pizza which was incredibly GOOD! ----> They only accept cash."
"January 26, 2018",50,Good Pizza,Good simple and delicious pizza. Priced well and consistent quality. Yum. I think they deserve top 5 rating in NYC for classic pizza. Better than Juliana's.
"January 25, 2018",30,"Good pizza, rough and ready place","Dropped in as it was close and I was cold. No alcohol. Busyish. Worn bench cushions, paper plates, plastic cutlery, but a good pizza."
"January 22, 2018",50,Huge Pizza,Was recommended to try Grimaldis. We wasn't disappointed. The pizza was gorgeous. Was well worth the walk across Brooklyn Bridge to try them
"January 21, 2018",40,Very good,"Grimaldi‚Äôs is always solid. Great classic brick oven pizza. Margarita is always solid, as it is with a little pepperoni."
"January 14, 2018",50,Must visit,Great pizza. Would definitely recommend if you go to Brooklyn. Cash only so be prepared. Can‚Äôt wait to go back again.
"January 10, 2018",50,Amazing,This was our favourite and cheapest meal of our entire trip to New York. We shared a large pizza between the two of us and struggled to eat it all. We're big pizza lovers and this place was something special.
"January 5, 2018",30,"Pizza was good, but didn't blow me away","Grimaldi's is famous for their pizza. We made sure to get there early to avoid the long line. The place is seriously busy, and their food is good. But it isn't the best pizza I've had. And I think it might be slightly over-rated."
"January 4, 2018",40,Chain pizza that is worth the trouble,"Flavors are still there, but the texture is not the same. I am hauling to the original Grimaldi‚Äôs of 1990ies, hence the scorn. It‚Äôs still worth the visit, as service is good and it ain‚Äôt a dollar slice - pizza worth trying."
"January 3, 2018",10,Never visit - go next door instead,"Plastic plates, plastic cutlery, plastic cups, rude staff, no beer on menu, cash only, long queue, average pizza. This place is not worth it trust me... please do yourself a favour and go next door for a better experience all round."
"January 1, 2018",20,Cold and long line,"We came here on winter, we had to wait outside on the cold but the problem was that it was cold inside too... as for the pizza it is good but not great. I would come back but for sure never on winter"
"December 30, 2017",50,The Hype is deserved,"Don't listen to everyone saying the Pizza is bad. I have had a lot of Pizza and this is fantastic. Jalapeno's were Spicy, the meat was tasty and the service was quick and friendly. Only thing they can do with is a liquor permit!"
"December 25, 2017",40,Must eat!,"Great food. We went here on a recommendation and were not disappointed! They didn‚Äôt take card when we went so just be mindful to have cash, although a cash machine isn‚Äôt far away. Would love to return"
"December 22, 2017",40,Great authentic pizza,"...the Italian way!! Met with some friends here for pizza after a few beers, really enjoyable and catered for veggie mates too."
"December 21, 2017",40,Perfect pizza!,Personal sausage pizza coal oven fired. Great crispy crust with top shelf tomato and mozzarella. The location was 6 th ave in Manhattan Chelsea district near 20th.
"December 16, 2017",50,Nice pizza shop. Don't go crazy over it.,Nothing special. Grab a slice pay and go or stay and enjoy a pie. No beer. Tasty but Brooklyn has a lot of nice pizza shops. I personally liked it. Brooklyn is my home town.
"December 10, 2017",50,Great Slice,Visited with A Slice of Brooklyn and some friends. We loved the pie! Great crust and perfect toppings.
"December 4, 2017",20,Not good Pizza,"Very average pizza, indifferent service, paper plates, plastic cutlery, cash only. I don't know what all the fuss is about this place? Do yourself a favour and go next door!"
"December 1, 2017",50,One of the best pizza places,I visit this location at least one a month they are know for there pizza I recommend staying with that not impressed with anything else in the menus . They are a cash only establishment.
"November 26, 2017",40,Good Pizza,"We got a large chicken pizza which was good and tasty but it wasn‚Äôt special! Also, they only accept cash. In overall, it‚Äôs a nice place and staff are friendly. The prices are fair."
"November 23, 2017",50,Delicious Pizza,"We were told the day previous by a Brooklyn firefighter that Manhattan has no good pizza. If he is comparing it to Grimaldi's, then he is correct. None of the pizza we ate in Manhattan could compare. Great slice!"
"November 22, 2017",40,Great Pizza. Great Atmosphere,Did a Brooklyn Pizza tour The tour included Grimaldi‚Äôs. Oven baked pizza using Coal Very flavoursome Good service No alcohol for sale Good experience
"November 16, 2017",20,Not as good any longer,"I was here 4 years ago and had a great experience . This time everything has change.Bad service, covercharge,plastic knife and papp plates.No candles and no beers anymore.I want not come back again.Few people."
"November 14, 2017",10,"Its OK, if you're not from NY",this pizza isn't awful. Enough said. Leave the lines to the hordes from out of town. Juliana's is better. 1800 other places in NYC are better.
"November 13, 2017",40,Excellent pizza,"Our biggest surprise was there was no line outside, which is not usual. The pizza was great, very tasty and the service friendly. Well worth the reputation."
"November 12, 2017",40,Great pizza - very reasonable,Great pizzas - come in two sizes: large and huge; and white or red with choice of toppings. The smaller one was more than enough for the two of us. Delicous pizza very reasonable price.
"November 9, 2017",50,Best pizza,Lucky visit‚Äîwe got a table right away. The weather had turned a little chilly so we didn‚Äôt have crowds to deal with. The pizza lives up to the hype!
"November 9, 2017",40,One of the best 3 in NYC,"If you are told pizza is just pizza send them to this place. Perfect topings, perfect taste and service should be improved."
"November 9, 2017",40,Kids s school trip,My daughter school went in the area for a trip and they decided to eta there it was really good pizza . It tasted fresher than your average pizza . Expensive but I understand why
"November 8, 2017",50,Delicious Pizza,I love Grimaldi‚Äôs pizza with its real New York style crust. And what a pleasant location by our beloved brooklyn bridge. Different toppings make it fun to order. An institution in brooklyn. A must!!!
"October 29, 2017",50,The godfather of pizza,No other pizza I‚Äôve eaten in the world compares. One of the only coal fired pizza places left in New York. Worth travelling around the world for you won‚Äôt be dissapointed.
"October 29, 2017",40,Huge pizzas,Great value. Huge pizzas with good range of toppings. All of us enjoyed it here. And they were playing Abba. A must before a walk over Brooklyn Bridge.
"October 29, 2017",40,New York pizza under the Brooklyn Bridge,Delicious! Great way to end a sunset walk over the bridge! Glad they were able to accommodate a veg option and use a clean knife to slice the pizza
"October 27, 2017",40,Great Pizza Cash Only!,"Good thing my kids brought cash only, no cards accepted. No beer or wine, I don't drink but that may be important for you. Pizza was awesome, great pepperoni"
"October 22, 2017",20,Watch out for service charge,Pizza was ok. Service the same. Didn't appreciate the mystery 5 dollars added to the tab. Was only told upon questioning what it was. I'm sure many a tourist has been caught out by this and tipped anyway. Don't fall for it.
"October 20, 2017",40,Great Pizza,"Great pizza in a fun area. Restaurant is mid sized, but a lot of tables makes it feel cramped. They seem to get you seated, fed and out the door. The pizza is worth the trip"
"October 18, 2017",40,Amazing pizza,"Delicious pizza, big portion for value. Slow service though and waiter a little rude. There was a queue to get into restaurant and about a 10-minute wait but pizza was really good."
"October 17, 2017",30,Good but not so much,Next to the Brooklyn bridge. Location beatiful. You have to do a long queue . Pizza is quite good but far away light years from the traditional Italian pizza.
"October 16, 2017",40,As advertised ...,The small pizza is big and tasty. Recommended. I don't think taking the long queu at the competitors (the original Grimaldi) next door is worth the wait. I wouldn't worry about the differences.
"October 14, 2017",50,Cool coal,Basic inside and no beer. But great pizza at good price. Unique coal taste. Definitely a recommend. Big pizza is perfect for two.
"October 10, 2017",40,Great Pizza!,"Outstanding Pizza! In a simple looking looking place. Great service, It's the food that speaks volumes! You will be a repeat customer!"
"October 8, 2017",40,NY history in the walls,"Great authentic feel, great pizza. Simple but effective. Went on a Wednesday so the queues weren't too bad at all."
"October 2, 2017",50,Still very good,"You probably read about the change in ownership, and the lawsuits, and all the other nonsense. But the oven is still the same oven, the ingredients are still the same old ingredients, and it's still really very very good"
"October 1, 2017",30,Family lunch,"Pizza is ok but i dont know what all the hype is about. There is nothing special about the pizza here...Over rated to be honest. The best pizza in new york is at Eataly"" opposite flatiron builing."
"October 1, 2017",10,no good,can not recommend this place - it is a tourist trap. Service is terrible and the pizza is nothing to write home about! There are so many better Pizza places in this town.
"September 30, 2017",10,Terrible.!!,Terrible service .. long wait.. .. first time in my life i eat in restaurant with plastic knife and fork !! Pizza was terrible .!
"September 29, 2017",40,Enjoyable,"The pizza was good. Nothing special special about the setting or the service. It was a real sit down eat off paper plates experience, but the pizza was delicious."
"September 29, 2017",50,Best Pizza,"The best New York stile pizza in Brooklyn, arrive early to avoid the long lines. It is the best pizza because of the quality of its dough and its ingredients, its fresh mozzarella is wonderful. The atmosphere is simple, simple with an industrial touch"
"September 18, 2017",50,Best pizza,"Bring your cash because they don't take credit cards. Pizza was amazing! This is a nothing fancy kind of place but you won't care when you eat the pizza. Paper plates, cash only, but you won't care after a taste. Highly recommend!"
"September 13, 2017",50,Such a light slice,"Tried this as part of a tour group so my experience is isolated. Had 2 slices of margarita, such a light and crispy pizza - gorgeous! Worth a try if you've not tried the coal-fired style."
"September 9, 2017",40,Great pizza-No air conditioning/liquor license,Interesting place with great pizza. You must buy whole pizzas. I was by myself and could only eat 1/3 (two large slices) of a small pizza. Pizza is delivered quickly and is thin crust. Cash only
"September 6, 2017",50,Awesome pizza!,Deliciouso! A definite visit when in Brooklyn! This is included on the Slice of Brooklyn Food Tour. Best thin pizza in Brooklyn.
"September 4, 2017",40,Delicious pizza!,Love visiting this place when going over to Brooklyn. There was a line when we got there but it moved fairly quickly. Pizza was very good.
"September 3, 2017",50,"Great pizza, an institution","Second visit here and just as good as nearly 10 years ago. Great tasting pizza, quick service, would go back if in New York."
"September 2, 2017",50,Best italian pizza in New York!,"It was raining and the queue was two-blocks long but it was worth waiting, the visa was solo delicious and authentic. A must try when in Brooklyn."
"September 1, 2017",10,Bad pizza and awful service,"If you like the pizza here, you must be a tourist. Waiters seem to be all Russian or Ukrainian, can't tell. Not friendly. No beer (no kidding). They've got an ATM for which you're charged $4. Stay away!"
"September 1, 2017",50,Amazing,"Recommended by bus tour guide, walked the bridge from downtown which was great and had lunch here... AMAZING! Laid back, no rush, no frills pizza place that tastes great and perfect hosts."
"August 28, 2017",50,Best Pizza in Brooklyn!,"We loved Grimaldi's Pizza! We devoured an entire brick oven Pizza and enjoyed our picnic at the nearby park. Under the Brooklyn Bridge - great view, exceptional food."
"August 21, 2017",30,Pizza with bad service,"Puzza was food for brick oven but we were ignored, never got more water, had to ask for our check.... had to ask for our check to be picked up... if you want true Brooklyn service, try here"
"August 15, 2017",40,"Good food, very touristy","Good pizza, but not exceptional. It's a good place for tourists. Service was excellent and the location is great."
"August 15, 2017",20,Way overrated,"Line too long,price too high and simply not worth it.There are so many better places.Coal 87,front street pizza,denino's in the city,dont settle for less"
"August 8, 2017",40,Pizza,Loved the pizza here. Atmosphere however is busy & loud. Went on the Brooklyn Pizza tour and this was 1 of the 2 pizza places on the tour.

"August 1, 2017",40,"Love this place, enjoyed the atmosphere and the pizza of course!!","We made the stop to, in my opinion the greatest pizza that New York has to offer. Grimaldi's is one of my top % in pizza restaurants, and going to the original one made my taste buds and stomach so happy."
"July 31, 2017",50,Excellent Pizza,"Worth the wait, always seems to have a waiting line. Pizza was delicious and not greasy at all. Fresh toppings and great flavors."
"July 27, 2017",50,First time having puzza,This pizza is so good. I'm hungry thinking about it. My first experience and I will definitely go back. I love pizza and in NJ there is good pizza and staten island. This place def top choice.
"July 26, 2017",40,Great pizza,"Long walk to get here but worth the trip, especially with a nice 67 degree evening in July. Great spot under the Brooklyn Bridge, gotta look to find it but worth it once you do."
"July 23, 2017",30,Average pizza,It was good but the pizza was average for NYC. Nothing Id be craving to go back to and if I was in the area of probably try something else.
"July 22, 2017",20,Not what we walked for,Great reviews so we walked 20 min to get there. Ordered Calzone. Maybe 6 slices of pepperoni and a few chicken pieces and loaded with ricotta cheese. Not at all appropriate. Great reputation but not a good experience.
"July 19, 2017",40,Great pizza,Now these pizzas are large and super tasty. It's quick service. Not overly friendly but efficient. No alcohol yet but says on menu the application is in
"July 19, 2017",40,What a pizza!,"Big juicy pizza, spot on. The staff is very friendly and tries to please the customers in several ways. Only cash, but there is an ATM machine on the second floor. Only negative, the olives were way too salted."

"June 11, 2017",50,Brooklyn classic,"Great pizza, but long wait. It's located under the Brooklyn bridge, which is fun, but also makes it a hub so plan ahead for that. When we went we ordered ahead and picked it up and we noticed there wasn't much free seating."

"May 17, 2017",40,Magnifico,Very good Italian pizza. Well worth the wait. It was also great to almost watch the pizza making process in Action almost like an art form. Note 1 pizza is enough for 2 people as they are huge

"March 1, 2017",40,A Pakistani's views,"If you're in Brooklyn, you got to try pizza from this spot. Busy place, we had to wait for our turn but we liked our experience. What we didn't like was crowding, stuffing of drinks crates on stairs & compulsory tip :)"
"February 27, 2017",10,Don't go,Get out of the line and go to Juiana's the true Grimaldi's and the very best pizza. You will thank me.

"January 16, 2017",40,Most amazing pizza,"After walking over the Brooklyn Bridge, we were really hungry. After about a 15min wait outside we sat at the counter and shared a steaming hot pizza between three. Simple, tasty and super thin crust."
"January 11, 2017",40,Great pizza,"Great pizza - with a thicker base than typical in New York, with good quality mozzarella and a good base sauce. Good location for a walk back to New York across Brooklyn bridge. The üöΩ in the restaurant are pretty dire though."

"December 27, 2016",30,Ok pizza,Cosy restaurant. Service was ok but took some time for the pizza to be ready. Not extraordinary but price was still ok for NY city.

"December 7, 2016",30,Disappointing Pizza,I only eat here when out of town guests insist. The pizza is mediocre and the lines are ridiculous. There are so many better pizza restaurants in the city...particularly in Brooklyn.
"December 6, 2016",40,Grimaldi's coal oven pizza,"Pizza ""under the bridge"" was well worth the wait! Line moves fast. Crispy crust and fresh mozzarella gave it an 'A'. Liquor license pending at time of review. They only take cash, no credit cards."

"November 13, 2016",50,The best!,"This location is a rock throw from the bridge park! There is nothing more authentic than Grimaldi's, it is the way pizza is supposed to be! Cash only though!"
"November 10, 2016",20,Gramaldi`s pizzas,Had to wait outside in line. Was not worth it. Nothing special about the restaurant or the pizzas. We had better in the airport.
"November 8, 2016",40,Saturday in Brooklyn,"Be prepared for long wait times both outside and after you place your order. This is a cash only establishment. Wonderful, wonderful pizza. Show up with a hearty appetite."

"November 4, 2016",20,No alcohol in the restaurant,"Nice place , but I got a surprise when I order for a bear and the waiter told me that they do not have license to sell alcohol ! üò≥. The pastry was wet due to the tomatoes ."

"November 1, 2016",40,Good Pizza.. Long Lines,We queued up to get in for around 40-60 mins to get a table for 2. The pizza was really nice and service was fast. Probably not worth the wait however. Worth noting that you must pay by cash!
"October 25, 2016",40,Good pizza,"Went on a recommendation and it didn't disappoint. It's the only pizza I've had in USA but was very good. Service nothing to write home about, as a few smiles wouldn't have gone amiss, but couldn't knock the food."

"October 20, 2016",50,Best Pizza in the Whole World!,"Get a slice, walk the river, or get two pies! Brick ovens in use still, and it's real NY pizza. Best pizza in the whole world, no joke."
"October 19, 2016",30,Not worth the hype,"Lines are long for this restaurant, so expectations are high. However, pizza was average: the mid-part rather soggy and crust was not as thin as expected for NYC pizza. Also no alcohol and you're eating with plastic plates and cutlery. Overall a disappointment."
"October 18, 2016",50,Visiting a legend,"We came here based on place's reputation. These visits usually end up to a disappointment but not this time. Main point here is clearly ""keep it simple"". They are focusing on pizza bottom and boy do manage that! Worth every coin! A strong thumbs up!"
"October 18, 2016",10,Don't bother - since it's moved,"Living off past reputation.. it's now moved to the corner. No beer, paper plates, poor service and forgettable pizza"

"October 17, 2016",50,Fantastic,"Wow! Thin crust pizza that rocks! Lots of ingredients to choose from, quick service. We devoured our pizza and ordered another. They also serve beer and wine I think. Definitely a treat."
"October 17, 2016",50,Decent food,It is slightly over priced but still better then a lot of other over hyped places near by but still good food
"October 16, 2016",50,Delicious Pizza!!,I now understand why the lines are so long. Lucky we were on a tour and could walk right in. We tried 2 different styles and both were yummy. Definitely recommend it!!
"October 13, 2016",40,Yummy pizza.,"Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a must when coming to Brooklyn. We went at 4 pm and was almost packed. The pizza was super delicious. The restaurant is small but was a cute decoration. The staff is ok, nice but not super helpful."
"October 11, 2016",30,Ordinary,This was a pizza place that looks old and shabby with customer service that was quite average. The pizzas were burnt and lacked flavour. Restrooms need a good overhaul and a clean. The tablecloth on our table was dirty. Wouldn't bother returning.
"October 10, 2016",50,Terrific brick oven pizza!,"Straight from Little Italy or Brooklyn, NY. FRESH INGREDIENTS, JUST DELICIOUS. Eat what you want and you do not feel stuffed. Perfect lunch!"
"October 10, 2016",20,Very bad,"First we had to wait a lot. Then we were seated in the bar, not in a table. After that they took very long to take our order. The plates, glasses everything plastic. And the pizza wasn't so good. Don't have anything with alcohol"
"October 9, 2016",30,Good place for pizza,"Old and well-known pizzeria in Dumbo. Their brick oven baked pizzas were good. We were three and had two ""small"" pizzas to share, which was great for a quick lunch."
"September 27, 2016",50,Awesome,"We've never really been fans of pizzas. It was absolutely amazing. Delicious, fresh and we will be visiting again. Totally yum. Then walked across the Brooklyn bridge."
"September 24, 2016",50,Worth the hype,This was one of the pizza restaurants on our 'go to' list during our visit to NYC. It didn't disappoint. Well worth the walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and the waterfront is lovely to stroll around afterwards.
"September 24, 2016",50,Great Pizza,We toured Brooklyn after walking the bridge and enjoyed the pizza! They need a beer license ! The pizza folded and tasted like a New York pizza should!
"September 24, 2016",40,Pizza,Nice ambiente with good pizzas. From the second floor you can see the guys actually making the pizza. The not so good part: they use only plastic plates and cutlery. This makes a lot of trash and is not very environment friendly :-(
"September 22, 2016",40,Family of 4,"A great place if you want a quick pizza. And good pizza. However, they have no wifi, no beer (!) and they do not accept credit cards. Good pizza, though...."

"September 18, 2016",50,Don't Settle for Other Pizza,It's the best and that's why you may see a queue. The other place for best pizza is Giuliana's which is close by.
"September 12, 2016",50,Superb pizza,Defiantly the best pizza I've had in a long time. Shame that it was so hot upstairs... That didn't bother us as the pizza more than made up for being a little warm!
"September 11, 2016",20,This is the best pizza in new york???,"Plastic plates, fork and knife?!? No chance to cut edge of pizza... no beer... the pizza was eatable, but this pizza can hide behing most pizzas in croatia... will not recommend to my friends..."
"September 4, 2016",50,Great authentic pizza!,Awesome pizza ! A NYC must ! One of the best we have had in NYC . Not licensed so don't expect beer or wine.
"September 2, 2016",50,Best pizza i ever had,Me and my partner ate here as we came off the subway before walking the Brooklyn bridge. Let me just say it was the best pizza we have ever had and great for the price. Great experience inside too good music and polite staff.
"September 1, 2016",50,Pizzaaaaaa :Q__,"Definetly one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten, it can be quite expensive if you get excited adding many ingredients but it worth the money."
"September 1, 2016",50,Authentic,"The large queue and the shouty manager gives you a true feel of New York. The pizzas were gargantuan and extremely delicious, and the design of the place is nice and very old fashioned, with red checkered table cloths etc. Would definitely recommend."
"August 31, 2016",50,Best pizza I've ever had...,"It is exactly what you'd expect. No frills, just great food. Real good atmosphere and well priced. Great after a walk over the bridge from New York City to stop off here for a slice (or 6) and a beer. Love it!"
"August 28, 2016",30,Overrated,"Food was not impressive. Found pizza to be average. Calzone was cold. Appetizer was ok. They only accept cash, no credit cards!! I was lucky I had $70 bucks in me."
"August 27, 2016",20,Ummmmm,Stood on line for a long time with a large number of people waiting to see what all the hype was about. Finally got inside and ordered a pie... Still not sure what all the hype was about besides the location perhaps.
"August 23, 2016",50,New York Pizza,"Some of the best pizza you'll find outside of Italy and it happens to be in the best borough, Brooklyn. Be prepared to wait on a long line. Call ahead of possible and order a pie. You won't regret it."
"August 21, 2016",40,Brooklyn - local pizza legand,The place is a bit more glamorous then the picture here. Locals love this place and the pizza is in itself a reward for visit....good atmosphere and service!
"August 18, 2016",40,Good thin crust pizza,Great with a crowd or a couple. Delicious pizza with your choice of toppings. Service is great. Waiters are helpful and suggestive for food choices.
"August 18, 2016",30,A tad overrrated,its definitely good pizza but all of us there agreed that they'd had better.Still must try this historic pizzeria in NY.
"August 16, 2016",40,Believe the Hype,"We had a delicious pie, served quickly by a professional staff. Was it the BEST pizza in NY? That's hard to say, since there's some really awesome pizza in NY, but Grimaldi's certainly makes a delicious pie."
"August 13, 2016",50,Great pizza!,We had the pizza with sausage. It was very nice. The staff is very friendly too. The location is great! And parking was easy to find.
"August 12, 2016",50,Expectations met!,Grimaldis surpassed my expectations. Best pizza crust ever! Service was really good. We also had dessert which was delicious as well :)
"August 11, 2016",10,Terrible pizza,GRimaldi's was on our hit list for places to eat and it was certainly popular but the pizza was truly awful. Can't recommend it at all had better from a take-away vendor in Manhattan.
"August 10, 2016",30,Overrated.,Very long waiting line. Pizza is good but there is many places with good pizza. Not worth waiting. Personals rude and bossy. I do not recommend this place.
"August 7, 2016",50,Dont leave Brooklyn without Grimaldi's,Excellent pizza.. Very authentic freshly made pizza. Seating is tight but the price and food are well worth the tight squeeze. Hidden gem under the Brooklyn Bridge. While here you will have an excellent opportunity to photograph the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges.
"August 3, 2016",40,Very tasty,Very good pizza but I don't understand the line for over a block. It's not necessary but it is very tasty. The only problem is the slices are pretty small from a regular slice. But probably one of the best slices I've tasted.
"August 2, 2016",40,Grimaldi's,"The food was delicious, staff friendly and prompt with seating us and taking our orders despite the place being overly crowded. And prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend!"
"July 28, 2016",10,Awful service,"I cannot understand the fuss about this place. Ok. The pizza is good, but waiting line is awful. The doorman is rude, unpolite, shameless. Or go when it is empty. Or go to your usual pizza place near your home. üò°üò°üò°"
"July 27, 2016",50,Good pizza,We had friends of our visiting from Atlanta and they wanted to try some of New York's finest pizza. So we decided to go to Grimaldi's. There wasn't a long line since it was in the winter time and the pizza was outstanding.

"July 14, 2016",50,"Winter, spring, summer, and fall the lines are out the door.","I have never stepped foot in this restaurant as I cannot eat carbs. However, the lines are out the door, and people can wait lunchtime up to 1/2 hour. So if you get the drift, the pizza must be outrageous!!!"
"July 13, 2016",40,Delicious Coal Oven Pizza,The coal oven pizza here is delicious. I highly recommend getting the pepperoni as it crisps up very nicely. Only complaints I have is the wait and now thy don't let you call and order to do takeout.

"July 8, 2016",50,Holiday In USA,Grimaldi's Pizzeria is on a very popular location under the Brooklyn Bridge. It looks very traditional. You can eat only whole Pizzas no slices from coal brick oven. The pizzas are very delicious.
"July 7, 2016",40,Good pizza in a authentic ambiance,"After walking Brooklyn Bridge, isthis a very nice place to have a pizza. The place is authentic, the pizzas are huge and very tastfull. They are made and baked on the spot, on charcoil. Very nice !"
"July 6, 2016",30,Ok experience,"I was told it is very famous. I had the pizza. It is not bad, but I wouldn't go for more of their pizza. They don't accept Credit Card, which was not really convenient."
"July 6, 2016",30,Wish I had tried instead of Juliana,"Grimaldi and Juliana are supposed to be competitors. I visited Juliana but did not like their pizza. I wish that I had gone to Grimaldi pizza. It is 50-50 whether it will be better than Juliana, but Grimaldi is my next choice."
"July 4, 2016",10,Pizza covered by ashes,I received too burned pizza while I ordered normal one. I could guess my pizza was used to heat others. I felt I was eating ashes. I didn't claim it because they brougt it for us to eat.
"July 3, 2016",30,Ok pizza - bad service,"We were treated in such a rude way since we arrived to the restaurant. Although the pizza was good, we will not return to this place and I couldn't recommend it because of the service."

"July 1, 2016",40,Great pizza,It was worth the wait to be seated in this restaurant because the pizza was so good. It's a busy place so the meal felt somewhat hurried. Plastic plates and utensils. Not licensed to serve alcohol.
"July 1, 2016",50,Pizza Lover,There might be a line and it might be crowded but it's worth the wait! Their pies (pizza) are the best in the city!! You can walk the bridge before or after -or both!- to work it off :-)
"June 28, 2016",50,Authentic Italian Pizza,"Not showy, just great Italian pizza! Service is quick, not a lot of chit chat, always busy, food is great. If you want ambiance, don't go here. The location near the Brooklyn Bridge does not serve alcohol either. Just so you know."

"June 21, 2016",40,Doesn't live up to the hype!,"Not as good as Juliani's next door. I would definitely recommend Juliani's over this. It's still a good pizza, just not as good as next door."
"June 21, 2016",40,Very good Pizza ......,"Grimaldi's is a must if you are in this area. Service was fast, pizza was good. Large pizza will feed 4. Compared with the pizzas in Italy, this is the closest in taste. Loved it, will go back."
"June 20, 2016",40,Tasty Italian Pizza,The pizza is pretty good! Tasty with traditional Italian crispy bread. I liked that we could see the chef making pizza.. I didn't like the waiter. It's clean but expensive.
"June 19, 2016",40,"Great pizza, no beer",This place doesn't have a licence. Nonetheless it's very good. We walked from Manhattan across the Brooklyn bridge - heartily recommend this.

"June 6, 2016",30,Overrated,"Hi all, if you know real pizza from Italy you rate this pizza low average. Friendly is not nice at all and you eat from a paper plate. Not again."
"May 31, 2016",20,minor league chain,"Why go here when the real deal, JULIANA'S, is a couple of doors down? So many better options in New York."
"May 26, 2016",30,"Yes, good pizza, rude staff, gonelsewhere","Honestly, it's a tourist trap. Relying on reputation. Had to wait in queue, then ushered in by staff on phone using hand gestures to show us to table. Should have walked out but we wete hungrry. The pizza was good but not outstanding. Go elsewhere."
"May 23, 2016",50,One of the best.....,"This is one of the best brick over pizza's you will eat. Usually a long line awaits you, but it is worth the wait. Menu is basic, salad and pizza and that is all you need !!"
"May 19, 2016",50,Great Pizza!,Definitely one of the best pizzas I've ever had. We tried both the standard pepperoni and a white pepperoni. I liked the standard (with sauce) better. The ingredients were so fresh and the crust was amazing!
"May 15, 2016",40,EARN SOME PIZZA AFTER WALKING THE BRIDGE,"The pizza at this NYC landmark is excellent, some of the best. The wait, however, could be long, and the setting needs improvement."
"May 14, 2016",50,Nicest pizza,"We was recomended by a Younman at the hotel for go here. Very nice italiensk pizza, but only serveing soft drinks."
"May 5, 2016",50,Great pizza,"We went there for lunch, we were lucky to be seated immediately. The pizza was amazing ,we enjoyed every slice the atmosphere was authentic and the service was very good."

"May 1, 2016",50,Nice pizza,Well area isnt known for great food but still this joint has better quality pizza then most others near by. Food is hygienic and prices are okiesh
"April 30, 2016",50,Yummy pizza,Good service and the best pizza I've tasted! Friendly staff! I would rather eat here that juliana's . The line was long but it was worth the wait!

"April 26, 2016",40,"Fab location, slice of history and a great slice of pizza",Did this as part of the the Slice of Brooklyn Pizza tour and had a great time. Nice atmosphere and pizza was delicious.
"April 24, 2016",50,Recommend by a friend,"Great fast service, top notch pizza and cheap for NY. If you are a couple and the queue is big don't be put off as there were loads of bugs groups waiting and we got in straightaway"
"April 14, 2016",50,Pizza,"Best place i have had pizza, very busy. Come early for a good seat. Great historic building in the heart of Dumbo and great pics of the city and Brooklyn bridge."
"April 12, 2016",50,Wow!,Loved it! Food was great; wonderful kitchen staff. Very nice inside. The selections were wonderful. You just felt right at home. Servers were very knowledgable of selections. It was a great environment!
"April 11, 2016",40,Best pizza in NYC,"Of course after seeing on Food Network I had to try it. I beat the 45 minute wait as I was alone. Food and service outstanding but no wine with your pizza soda only and cash only, great place for families"
"April 8, 2016",40,Great pizza,Walked over Brooklyn bridge especially to visit and weren't disappointed. Lively atmosphere and no fuss service. Place was busy and there was 7 in our party but staff found a table for us no problem. Quick friendly service and great pizza. Well worth a visit
"April 6, 2016",30,Havey avarage,"Pizza was way overcooked you , plates are plastic,there are no reservation,we waited outside of pizzeria, staff is very nice and kindly,pizza great but nothing special ...."
"April 5, 2016",20,Tourist trap,The pizza is your typical thin crust pizza at above average prices. They charge a lot of money for each topping. Been there a few times and I'm not overly impressed with it.
"March 29, 2016",50,Worth the wait,"Best pizza ever! What more can I say!! Thin crust, fresh mozzarella cheese and basil. Yummy sauce Worth the wait And they do NOT sell slices. Get a whole pie, you won't be sorry!!!"
"March 28, 2016",50,Wow.,I can keep typing wow till the review ends. Had vegetarian pizza.. Wow. Crust and sauce and cheese and ingredients. The whole pizza tasted out of this world. Highly recommended.
"March 27, 2016",50,Best...Pizza...Ever,Small family owned pizzeria underneath the Brooklyn Bridge. The coal pizza oven makes a wonderfully crisp crust. You can't go wrong with any toppings. Thoroughly enjoyed the food. Would love to take the family back when in NY again.
"March 24, 2016",40,Really good,This is a chain of pizza restaurants and I believe this may have been the original. This place makes really good pizza's with excellent toppings. What I like best is the chew of the crust. It's really good. Prices are good as is the service.
"March 22, 2016",30,Nothing special,"We are Italians visiting NY and were expecting to taste something at least close to Italian pizza. The crust was fine however the toppings weren't top notch. olives were too salty, mozzarella not quite that. Atmosphere was quite alright and service good."
"March 20, 2016",50,Great!,"Great pizza, great service and reasonably priced. I've had a lot of pizza in a lot of places and this is my choice for the best pizza in New York. No question."
"March 17, 2016",50,Delicious pie,The ingredients were fresh and the pie is made where you can see it. It's one of the best pizzas I've had. The atmosphere is fun with oldies playing in the background and very close to the Brooklyn Bridge
"March 17, 2016",50,NYC pizza,Stopped in prior to Brooklyn Bridge walk. We were seated immediately by friendly staff. Great pizza at reasonable price. Highly recommend if walking the BB is in you plans.
"March 10, 2016",30,Good,A good pizzeria that is overpriced. You pay for the views and is also very noisy filled with many tourists
"March 7, 2016",50,The best pizza,"Was recommended by a friend and they were right, the pizza was excellent and you can't beat the price. It was busy nonstop and you should expect up to a 45 minute wait but we got lucky and was seated within 10 minutes."
"March 7, 2016",50,Amazing!!,"You definitely need to visit this amazing pizzeria... Great hospitality, very kind personnel!! Great ideas for unique pizzas, very high quality, very big pizza, perfect taste!! Need to try!!!"
"March 5, 2016",50,Good food and atmosphere,Very busy but staff were very laid back and calm. Lovely atmosphere with Beatles tracks being played. Pizza's are HUGE and very nice. You get paper plates and plastic cutlery which obviously cuts down on washing up but that didn't spoil the experience for me.
"March 3, 2016",40,"Great Pizza, worth the hassle","The pizza really is amazing. Mine was a bit burnt on the bottom, as some other reviewers have noted, which is why not 5 stars. The service is typical for NYC (bad). Cash only!"
"February 25, 2016",50,Lives up to reputation,Worth the wait. Some of the best pizza you'll ever have. And family friendly. Make sure you are hungry.
"February 21, 2016",30,Decent pizza,"The pizza was OK, the small pizza was more than enough for us both. Even though it's a restaurant, the place has a fast food feeling with the plastic cups, plates and cutlery. Not dying to come back."
"February 20, 2016",50,Excellent service,We were seated immediately upon arrival into the restaurant and received excellent customer service from all members of staff. Our pizza was delicious and reasonably priced.
"February 19, 2016",20,So not worth it.,Long line ups. Way overpriced. Get over yourselves. Not even remotely close to good enough for the price.
"February 18, 2016",10,Cheap and nasty,"Didn't even stay long enough to sample the pizza,plastic cutlery and plates, no beer or wine.Toilets not clean.Glad we didn't stay."
"February 16, 2016",10,Never again!,Terrible is the only word for this place. Plastic plates and cutlery. The chicken on the pizza died of dehydration and NOT in a slaughter house
"February 16, 2016",30,Ok.....just ok,"Nice pizza but for petes sake....spend some money on the decor. The bathrooms (toilets to the English) are absolutely disgusting, and you eat off plastic plates. And worst, you can't even get a beer! Poor"
"February 13, 2016",50,Delish!,"Don't let the line up out the door fool you! It won't be long and it's well worth the wait! The two story pizzeria has delicious food, great staff, and a true Brooklyn feel. A must with Every visit to New York!"
"February 10, 2016",50,Extremely popular & great pizza,"Old-school traditional New York pizza. Restaurant was once a bank, so the interiors are pretty cool. The line for this place can sometimes be really long, but we lucked out and got seated right away. Enjoyed every bite!"
"February 3, 2016",10,Tourist trap,Went there for dinner. The pizzas are big and price is average for New York. The pizza was not very good. The dough was sticky and humid. Would not recommend. I can't see where all the fame comes from...
"February 2, 2016",50,Wonderful! Fast! great service!,"Needed a quick, wonderful pizza and they came through. Bonus of great reputation. Would enjoy again!"
"January 27, 2016",40,ian & julie,"we went here on the slice of Brooklyn tour, eating authentic Italian pizzas under the Brooklyn Bridge is amazing, the staff there go above what you expect, and the pizza, have the Margarita, the views from their front door has to be seen"
"January 9, 2016",40,"Long wait, basically worth it",Went here with a friend on a whim one Saturday morning for brunch. Pizza is great but the line was ridiculous and the atmosphere is medium charming. I'm still loyal to Lucali's.
"January 5, 2016",50,Gourmet pizza!,We ordered takeout 2 nights before Christmas. The veggie pizza was delicious and the fresh arugula was packaged separately so that we could add it when we got home. My husband and son ordered the pannini burger and pronounced it excellent.
"January 2, 2016",50,Best pizza ever,"We had to wait in the cold in line for a half hour, but it was well worth it. We ordered the sausage pie. I dreamed about it for several days afterwards. Then we walked over the Brooklyn Bridge."
"December 28, 2015",50,Good Pizza,Fast service and good Pizza! Cool to watch them make the pizza. Just the right amount of cheese and sauce

"December 25, 2015",50,Pizza to die for,"One of the best pizza's I have eaten anywhere in the world. Only a short walk from the terrific viewpoint of Brooklyn Bridge/Manhattan, so very very convenient. Pizza was reasonably priced, served HOT and quickly, and was outstandingly good."
"December 17, 2015",50,Awesome,Recommended by friends and don't regret the journey. We are staying by grand central station so was a bit of a trek but good pizza and service
"December 16, 2015",50,"Great pizza, the rumours are true!","Heard about Grimaldis and it didn't disappoint! The pizza was lovely though there was a bit of a wait, firstly in terms of for a table and secondly for our food. Good vibe in there too - lovely stuff!"
"December 14, 2015",30,Not So Great,This place has a big name in the NY pizza scene but they are becoming too commercialized. The pizza is OK and maybe even good but there are tons of places that are much better. Lombardi's is one of them!
"December 14, 2015",50,Walk the bridge have a pizza,Having walked across Brooklyn Bridge it was definitely time to eat. No better place than Grimaldi's to rest your weary legs and eat pizza. 3/4 person was ideal for 3 of us.
"December 11, 2015",50,Best pizza in New York,"Really good, honest no-frills pizzeria in Brooklyn. We made our way to Grimaldi's from Manhattan and it was well worth the hike. Pizza here is out if this world!"
"December 8, 2015",50,NEW YORK'S BEST PIZZA,"You will not regret crossing Brooklyn Bridge to get to this pizzeria. There was only one problem with the food, we did not order enough!"
"December 8, 2015",50,Great Experience,There is certainly something to be said for cooking Pizzas the old fashioned way. Nice atmosphere. The visit was part of a tour but it was very well organised and we were not kept waiting.
"December 6, 2015",40,PIZZA!!!!,"Beautiful food, great atmosphere. Would definitely recommend this pizzeria to someone who wants to try New York style pizza"
"December 5, 2015",50,Be prepared with cash,Great pizza - overpriced but fun experience and great area to walk around - sweeping views of Manhattan. Good topping choices and good service. Had a baby with us on line and they let us wait inside
"November 26, 2015",50,Very tasty,Visited at the lunch time. We wait in line for approximately 20 minutes. But the pizza was worth of it. We took small with pepperoni. It was too big for two. Delicious!!! I will recommend the place for everyone
"November 26, 2015",40,Popular pizza restaurant,Seemed to be almost always a queue for a table but we were quite lucky and got seated right away. Simple straight forward menu of pizza served on plastic plates and plastic knives and forks. Can understand why the place is so popular!
"November 23, 2015",50,Great Pizza,There was a queue but it was worth it. Staff very friendly. Service superb. Receptionist very entertaining. Always keeps you updated.
"November 18, 2015",50,Delicious,This is a No Fuss.. plastic plates and napkins place.. The taste of the pizza is amazing.. delicious YUM!!!!
"November 14, 2015",50,Wow,"Amazing place pizza is so delicious and fresh, truffle dessert was so out of this world.....it is a cash only establishment tho so cards don't go far here"
"November 13, 2015",50,Authentic Italian Pizza,"This is, hands down, some of the best pizza I've had - anywhere in the world. This is the kind of authentic flair you can't find anywhere. It's cash only, but worth every red cent!"
"November 5, 2015",50,Best of the Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Worth the trek to Brooklyn and waiting in line in the cold. Best pizza I have ever had and equally great and friendly service. Will visit again on next trip for sure!!

"November 4, 2015",40,Great pizza,"Had to visit its a must do pizza place in Brooklyn. the line moved quickly and soon got a table. Good pizza, served quickly.Small was enough for 2 people."
"November 2, 2015",40,Isa a nica pizza fohgetabouitttt,The pizza was great ... I have been to Italy so would not say it was the best I've had but watching these guys make it is really something! It is easy to see how this place has gained so much popularity!!
"October 31, 2015",40,Great way to refuel after walking over the bridge,One pizza between three of us was fine. We added toppings 'half and half' to accommodate the veggie! Service was quick and staff were really good - turned the music down after a request from my mum who was under the speaker. Well done!
"October 30, 2015",40,Grimaldi's pizzeria,Margerita pizza with homemade meatball and mozzarella cheese + A glass of brooklyn draft beer =perfect!!!!!
"October 28, 2015",50,Amazing pizza!,This was by far the best pizza we are whilst in NY. Well worth the trip over the bridge and not all that expensive either. Not one to be missed.
"October 26, 2015",50,Worth the wait...,"Seating is tight, service is OK.. but hands down BEST pizza in town! We stayed in the city but ventured over to Brooklyn specifically for this pizza and were not the least bit disappointed. Will definitely be back on our next visit to NYC!"
"October 18, 2015",40,A tad overrated,"I really liked the experience, but unfortunately I think it's a little hyped up...the food was delicious and the service was fantastic, but definitely not the best pizza I've ever had. Reasonably priced and great atmosphere. Definitely try it once!"
"October 17, 2015",50,Really touristy - but really fun!!!,"We really loved Grimaldi's!! Super busy, great vibe and delicious pizza!! Went the first time on a Slice of Brooklyn Pizza tour - but then went again on another trip to NY a few months later. Great service!!"
"October 16, 2015",50,Fantastic pizza,"The thin crust pizza is to die for. Great pizza, great atmosphere, great location. The owners are there to assist."
"October 15, 2015",10,Terrible place,"After waiting more than an hour to get in, the service was terrible.ii was very dissapointed with the pizza. It's like mass production, i felt rhst they were hurring us up im order to seat other people. I will not recommend this place"
"October 12, 2015",40,Pizza no beer,"Pizza was very good. I was disappointed that I could not get a beer or glass of wine with it. We waited for 30 minutes to get in and another 45 minutes after ordering, The pizza was worth the wait though."
"October 12, 2015",20,Meh,"Tasteless overall, soggy and chewy crust. Cheap but not worth the wait. Try Totonos or diFaras if you want good Brooklyn pizza. Any of my neighborhood pizza joints are better."
"October 6, 2015",50,Lived up to its reputation,Looked forward to this meal for weeks. No surprise it was exceptional. The history of the place was also excellent. Would definitely go back
"October 2, 2015",50,"If you want pizza, go there","After reading all suggestions to go for pizza there and standing outside in the queue in 27 degree sun to get in, it was worth every cent! Best pizza and then work it off across Brooklyn Bridge back to Manhattan."
"September 29, 2015",50,As long as you like Pizza...,"The lines move quickly, and the pizza is excellent, thin fresh dough, with fresh mozzarella slices, cooked in a very hot coal fired oven."
"September 28, 2015",50,This was on the list and it did not disappoint!,"Stood in line before it opened. Was not disappointed! The pizza is that good! Make sure you bring cash, that is all they accept. The service was quick and the food is great!"

"September 24, 2015",50,A must when walking to Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan,"Have been here many times over the years, but this was my first at the new, larger location - food did not disappoint and now with the improved waterfront, it's an even better destination."
"September 24, 2015",40,The pizza is so good I want to marry it,"The crust is amazing. The mozzarella is homemade and jaw droppingly good. I highly recommend this place. I went to this place while on the Slice of Brooklyn pizza tour, which is also very good."
"September 21, 2015",20,There's better in NY,Had to try it once....long wait..nothing special..... I prefer Arturos on Houston. Save your time....go around the corner..it's better.
"September 20, 2015",10,worst service ever!,"it has the worst service and the pizza is not good at all. Dont even come and waste your time ! We asked 3 times the bill, i think they dont want to earn money."
"September 17, 2015",10,Absolutely terrible,"The pizza was burned, and we had to wait 45+ minutes. Terrible pizza, terrible atmosphere. Don't go."

Service and long food Waiting are the weakness.. But the tradicional and pepperone pizza are delicious!!! Hard to park The car. Will come back for sure!"
"September 15, 2015",10,Pizza very average. Service appalling.,"Had better pizza from dominos, server was more interested in looking out the window,not once asked if everything was ok,or if we required another drink, totally ignorant, and unprofessional, plastic plates & knifes and forks, will tell people to keep away."
"September 15, 2015",40,Different pizza,Great pizzas with some unusual toppings for us visiting from Iceland. We had to wait a while for a table but it was worth the wait.
"September 15, 2015",40,Great pizza,"Great pizza, decent enough service. Absolutely always busy, so not for those who appreciate quiet or much space."
"September 14, 2015",40,Great pizza!,Read reviews that we needed to eat the pizza here while in NYC for the first time. It did not disappoint. Fast service and delicious pizza!! Ordered one pizza and was large enough to share for four people.
"September 14, 2015",30,Fun place to get pizza and see Dumbo in Brooklyn,"Not the best pizza in NYC, but a fun experience. The Brooklyn version of Grimaldi's is in a nice neighbourhood called Dumbo. Close to Grimaldi's you can get the best views of Manhattan from the pier."
"September 10, 2015",40,A Must See,Definitely a place to go in Brooklyn! Authentic coal-fired pizza and the white pizza is unbelievable!
"September 9, 2015",30,"Good, not great","And not worth the wait. Plus no booze, wine or beer. Only soft drinks in a plastic bottle and plastic cup of ice."
"September 9, 2015",50,Don't Miss Grimaldi's Pizza!,"Grimaldi's is my very favorite pizzeria! Discovered it 6 years ago and finally got to go back. Don't worry about the line, it's worth the wait!"
"September 9, 2015",40,Italian Food by the Hudson,Visit this restaurant by tripadvisor. Perfect Pizza's good to share with your friends and fear prices The nice thing was the plastic plates and fork and knife. Not expected but nice.
"September 8, 2015",10,A eviter,"Service d√©plorable, pizza sans go√ªt, pas d'alcool, √† √©viter ! restaurant for tourist, tasteless pizza server that treat us like animals and no alcohol! to avoid !!!"
"September 6, 2015",50,Best pizza in NYC,Yes the wait was long- but I don't regret waiting;-) I think that was the best pizza I've tried -at least so far! The prices were ok. The stuff was nice. Highly recommended!
"September 4, 2015",50,Great pie!,"Great pizza, visited for a late lunch yesterday with my daughter, their Margurita pizza is delicious....nice, thin, light crust."
"September 3, 2015",30,Pizza for the price !!,"Great pizza, nice cheese , good topping choices and fun nostalgic atmosphere Service leaves something to be desired, but I'm a Seattlite living in Brooklyn so that seems pretty typical but all in all good pizza for the price"
"September 3, 2015",50,Brooklyn pizza tour,Great tasting pizza and brilliant soda. Its queued round the block but the tour has tables booked. Went as part of the Brooklyn pizza tour. Part of a great day out in New York
"September 1, 2015",30,Over-hyped,"Exceptionally rude ""Host"" treating everyone like dirt. Pizza ok but far too much tomato sauce resulting in a wet pizza base. Recommend getting the white pizza instead."
"August 22, 2015",40,"Best in Brooklyn, maybe","Plastic plates and cutlery and no alcohol does not distract from fine pizzas. Everyone was happy and they kept coming. Toilets were unpleasent but you go for the pizzas, enjoy them they are good."
"August 19, 2015",40,Summer Friday's after the fireworks in Coney Island,This is a nice place to have some pizza and salad with the family/friends after some nice fireworks BUT make sure you get there before they end because it gets packed....
"August 19, 2015",30,Doesn't live up to the hype,I like thin crust pizza and Grimaldi's is supposed to be better because the oven is coal-fired. What I got was a pizza with over-cooked cheese and a burnt crust.
"August 16, 2015",40,YUM!!!,"Really great thin crust pizza in a relaxed atmosphere. Can get quite busy, so going off-peak hours is recommended. Beware: they only accept cash."
"August 16, 2015",40,I Love Brick Oven Pizza,This is one of the best pizzas in NYC. It is worth the lines and wait. I have never been disappointed.
"August 16, 2015",30,I think it's over-rated,Had to wait for a time to get in. There are a number of street side restaurants that offer pizza that is just as good. But it is a landmark so if that gives you bragging rights.
"August 12, 2015",50,Lunch,Awesome pizza! We had to wait in line for 45 mins but it was worth it. Small pizza fed 2 of us easily. Cash only but there is an ATM in the restaurant.
"August 12, 2015",50,Yummy,This was our first experience of NY pizza. We combined with a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge to get there from Manhattan. The queue to get in looked impossibly long but we decided to stick with it and were totally glad we did.
"August 12, 2015",30,Famous Grimaldi's,"Very old historical type building. Bathrooms up the stairs, not handicap friendly :( Pizza very tasty but extremely thin for me I felt you paid alot for not much on the crust. Would I go back..no not worth it."
"August 10, 2015",50,Mmmm..................,"Pizza was fantastic, staff was friendly and helpful, prices were reasonable. What else can you ask for? There's nothing quite like pizza baked in a coal fired oven."
"August 8, 2015",30,Good food - poor service,The pizza was good however we were directed to a table and later asked what we wanted. That was the only communication we had with a staff member. They are used to filling the seats without being at least polite.
"August 4, 2015",10,RERRIBLE PIZZA USING GRIMALDI NAME> JULIANA'S NEXT DOOR IS THE ORIGINAL GRIMALDI'S AND TASYES IT. GRIMALDI'S CONS U FIND,Not worth the hype or price!!! @ best a slightly less than ordinary pie.There are 3 better pizza parlors on the same block as Grimaldi's.
"July 26, 2015",40,Buena pizza,"I don't know if it is the best pizza in New York as some people say, but sure it is a very good pizza, if you're in Brooklyn it deserves a visit."
"July 24, 2015",30,Good pizza,Lots of tourists Line outside when we went Moved quickly Good thin crust pizza loaded with cheese not much sauce Limited menu pizza and antipasto - for example salad not an option

"August 9, 2014",30,Meh,Too much hype. I much prefer joes or bens pizza. Not so impressed. I wouldn't wait on line for that. The atmosphere is nothing much. But it is a cool old building
"August 7, 2014",50,New York Pizza for West Coast boy,"Yum, the Pizza came quickly, it was tasty, and we were seated as soon as we arrived. I appreciated that they keep the price reasonable. Service was friendly and fast."
"August 6, 2014",50,Delicious!!!,Excellent pizza!! Def a must try!! We didn't have to wait in any line that I heard I might have to do but when we left there was a line starting!! We went around 11:30 am
"August 5, 2014",20,The flavorless pizza,It looked great but It lacked taste. I went all the way to Coney Island and I was extremely disappointed.
"August 1, 2014",40,I enjoyed it,Delicious pizza. We didn't have a crazy wait- maybe 15-20 minutes. Service inside was a little slow and lacking but overall good pizza and good place.
"August 1, 2014",50,Huge portions.,Excellent value for money and great tasting pizza. The small pizza was enough for a family of 3. Had to cancel the large when I seen the size of the small. The staff were very understanding even though they had already prepared it.
"July 30, 2014",10,Worst Restaurant we visited in NYC/BRKLN,"Menu is terrible, they do not tell you they don't serve beer until after you have already ordered. Tomatoes were green. Service was SLOOOOWWW. Avoid this place."
"July 30, 2014",50,Great Authentic Italian Pizza,The pizza was great but would have liked to have seen some salads or even breadsticks or subs also on the menu
"July 26, 2014",30,Should be call - Minimal Service Pizza,"Did wait much to be seated, but waited 42 minutes for pizza and during entire 60 minute stay the waiter stop twice: to take order and give bill. No beer or wine and cash only. Oh and pizza is ok."
"July 24, 2014",30,Line so long for just a regular pizza!,We were in line outside for one hour! The pizza is not bad but it just taste like any good pizza! Their calzone is huge!! I went to Vegas a week after this and saw it fashion show mall with no line.
"July 21, 2014",30,OK pizza but worth the experience,Obviously went through the ‚Äú20 minutes waiting outside experience‚Äù. Once inside it‚Äôs nice to check out all the pictures hanging on the walls. The pizza is good but nothing ‚Äúwow‚Äù and the service is average. But it‚Äôs worth the experience.
"July 16, 2014",40,"Great, but it ranked Juliana's better","Great pizza, not great service though. It's almost like they see too many customers and simply can't be bothered. Juliana's next door is MUCH better in every way!"
"July 3, 2014",50,Best pizza,Being from texas we have limited pizza options but they do include a franchise grimaldis which is not bad but does not compare to this great place. It was worth the 30 min sub ride from hotel and walk during this 90 degree day
"July 3, 2014",40,Will stop here every time I visit New York.,"Pizza is fantastic, perfect crispy thin crust and great flavor. Coal oven pizza is one of my favorite ways to have pizza. Servers are not very friendly, but price was good less than twenty bucks for a meal for two is great in New York."
"July 1, 2014",40,Great Pizza!,A delicious pizza to eat everywhere. I bought it and ate at the Dumbo park and it was a really nice experience. Place looks also nice to dinne in! Try both options!
"July 1, 2014",10,Over-rated,This place is a tourist trap. It's just famous for the sake of being famous. It's not even in the top 20-30 places I've had pizza. I had to wait 45 minutes because the oven was being cleaned and the pizza wasn't even average
"June 28, 2014",20,Go somewhere else,"Average comes to mind. Not sure what all the hype is about. Luckily we got there early and didn't have to queue for a table. Staff were not friendly. Eat somewhere else in DUMBO, you won't be missing out."
"June 28, 2014",30,average,Very average pizza. Waiting line went quickly but the pizza was just average. Quality ingredients but not what it is cracked up to be.
"June 25, 2014",50,Perfect way to celebrate walking across the bridge,"Perfect pizza. Perfect atmosphere. Perfect staff and service. Well done! Only thing I would change about this place would be to accept credit cards. Come on guys, this is the 21st Century."
"June 24, 2014",50,New York Mission Trip march 2014,"Fast and accomidating service...............especially since they were packed.Excellent food ,especially pizza..... Getting there and finding parking was the only issue."
"June 18, 2014",40,Their Small Za was HUGE,"To us Canadian, that small pizza is a large size so you have been forewarned. I did not see anyone ordering a large pizza. The line up there was long too."
"June 11, 2014",10,Disgusting,"The music was too loud and inapropiate, the service was bad and the bill was at least not very clear."
"June 9, 2014",20,I have no idea why people stand in line for this,"Very dull, tasteless pizza. Very little sauce, and the crust was burnt. Uncomfortable chairs & small table -- no room to breathe. The restrooms were a mess. Skip this line."
"June 9, 2014",30,Still favor new haven pizza!,"We had a white pizza with fresh tomato mozzarella garlic and extra fresh basil. Was good but not great. Also a red mozarella pie. Thought sauce s little bitter. Good enough, but after reading reviews would try Juliana's next door next time"
"June 4, 2014",50,Great pizza,If you want pizza in New York this place is worth the walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. Best we have had. Keeps things simple pizza choice of toppings & bottled drinks.
"June 4, 2014",40,I'd cross the Brooklyn Bridge for this,"Really good NY pizza! Great location, great atmosphere. Just under the bridge on the east side. It's a younger crowd with lots of music. The restaurant is in an old historic bank building."
"May 28, 2014",50,GOD eats at Grimaldi's,"we all know God is great! but when he wants pizza he go's to Grimaldi's. just pure pizza , they way god intended it!"

"April 28, 2014",10,Slow and anti human,What do you think about 55 min waiting for a simple pizza? No smile. No cards. No alcohol. Just anti human... No entry!
"April 24, 2014",50,Best pizza ever,Hands down the best pizza I have ever ate. Crust was thin and crisp. Toppings were great but honestly sauce and cheese are all that's needed. Line was not too long with about a 15 min wait. I could eat this pizza everyday
"April 21, 2014",50,great New York pizza,coming from Regina's territory in Boston I would definitely say this pizza is worth a visit. great sauce and crust and reasonable for New York.
"April 20, 2014",50,Best pizza ever,Not even in Italy I tried a pizza as tasty and perfect like this! The place is great and pizza is crazy. Price is perfect! Dont miss out. Maybe you will have to wait in line but it totally worth it.
"April 15, 2014",40,One of the 1st pizzeria's in new york,pizza is great but be prepared for a long wait as it is very busy. It might be hard for smaller children to wait on line.
"April 2, 2014",50,Great pizza,Excellent pizza great service....no beer but water and pop we were good with. Must do while in Brooklyn my suggestion take subway there then walk across bridge much better view
"March 31, 2014",50,Mmmmm Pizza!,This place does THE BEST coal baked margarita pizza. So delish! It is a quiet little joint not far from Brooklyn Bridge.
"March 30, 2014",50,No slices here,Nice thin crust pizzas where you can see them make the crust and build the pizza from your table. The pizza maker was constantly busy. Wash it down with a bottle of pop and you are good to go.
"March 22, 2014",30,Not the best but good enough,"Waited 30 minutes. Not bad on a sunny spring day. Good pizza, not the best. Crust a little soggy. Anti pasta fair but would go back."

"March 7, 2014",50,"Thin ,crust pizza!!","This pizza is simply delicious. The restaurant is charming; service was fast and friendly. You can watch them as they make the pizzas...very cool. Thin crust, fresh mozzarella, delicious pepperoni. Best pizza we've had in NYC across three long visits!Only cash!!We had a nice lunch!!"
"March 4, 2014",50,Great pizza!,A classic New York establishment. I was worried when they moved from their original location but the food is still amazing and now they can accommodate more people
"March 4, 2014",40,Tourist spot,Pizza is all right.I grew up in Brooklyn and there is a few better place without the line and tourist.
"March 4, 2014",50,The Best Pizza Ever!!!,I traveled to this Pizzeria after reading about it some place. It was by far worth the trip. I love Pizza and consider to be very picky when trying new places. I would say the best pizza ever!!
"March 4, 2014",40,great pizza close to the bridge,This is the best pizza this side of the bridge...take patience with you because lines are long but well worth the wait. Summers are good here for obvious reasons!!!
"March 4, 2014",40,Best pizza in brooklyn,"No slices, medium pie would be enough for 2-4 people, no more. Hard, crunchy crust, freshh mozzarella, tomato & basil, additional toppings extra. Another location is on Coney Island, we visited both, same quality, Coney Island nice view facing the beach."
"March 4, 2014",50,Great Pizza at a good price,Great Pizza at a good price The only downside is that at times you might need to wait hours before you can be seated which is kind of crazy. I suggest you call before going.
"March 2, 2014",50,Best Pizza!,"We loved it here! The pizza was delicious!! Nothing but crumbs left after we got finished!!! We caught the water taxi to Brooklyn and had a wonderful, tasty lunch here under the Brooklyn bridge. It was a great memory"
"February 28, 2014",40,Really good pizza but ...,"Very enjoyable pizza, a classic NYC experience, like going to Lombardi's, that needs to be done. For me though, not in the top 10 pizze I've ever had. Make sure you try the ice cream shop down the hill afterwards for dessert."
"February 28, 2014",30,Good but NOT Worth Standing In Line For,The pizza is good but it doesn't live up to the hype. There's nothing extraordinary about it and it's not worth standing in line outside for 45 minutes for.
"February 22, 2014",50,"Delicious, fresh and hot",Fantastic NYC pizza with friendly service and no pretension. Weird spot nestled near the base of the bridge on Front street but a great building. Brilliant prices and we loved that you just create your own pizza. Beautiful

"January 8, 2014",40,Different preferences,"My wife and I have been to Grimaldi's several times and enjoy it. However, our son, who lived in Chicago for awhile, prefers that style with its much thicker crust and more generous ingredients."
"January 4, 2014",50,"""Thanks CSI new York"" !","Having heard this restaurant mentioned on CSI New York, decided we had to try and find it. We did and weren't disappointed. Got there early so no need to queue. .Great Pizza and desserts - if you can fit them in!"
"December 21, 2013",50,Walked over Brooklyn Bridge to eat here and soooo worth it!,"Best pizza I've ever had anywhere in USA! Big fan of NYC Ray's Pizza, but this is way better. Heads up though - can't buy slices and they only take cash. Highly recommend you go. It's right across/under the Bridge."
"December 14, 2013",50,"Long line, but worth it",The line was ridiculously long...but it was worth it. This place is small and you end up sitting right next to people you don't know. But you end up eating some of the best pizza ever. Worth the wait. Period.
"December 11, 2013",50,Best pizza I've had in my life,The pizza was amazing like how we could put red chili flakes and fresh parmigiana and franks red hot it took along time for it to come but it was so good.Next time im in New York I will be eating here again.
"December 4, 2013",50,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,"Great, great pizza but do expect a wait. This is a well-travelled destination for people walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. Its gotten pretty touristy but it still is some of the best pizza in NYC."
"December 2, 2013",50,Great pizza!,"Had heard great things of this place and wasn't disappointed, one of the best pizza we have eaten would defo return! Another plus is great views of the bridge from the bottom of the street!"
"December 2, 2013",40,Good Pizza,"Pizza was good but not the best I've ever had. I liked the thin crispy crust and the fresh mozzarella but the pizza didn't have a ton of flavor. I expected it to be amazing, but it want."
"November 25, 2013",50,Wait for the best,"Don't be deceived by the huge line, you will get in. We waited on a Friday night for about 30 min. After the pizza arrived, I could see why the wait. Brick oven crust, fresh toppings--it all makes a difference!"
"November 12, 2013",40,"True NYC pizza, well worth trip to Brooklyn","Visited Grimaldi's upon recommendation found on the internet and were not disappointed.

"October 10, 2013",50,perfect Pizza,Love the regular pizza with double helpings of pepperoni and its great with a few flakes of chilly on top. Yummy and uncomparable to any other pizza.
"October 8, 2013",50,Not your regular American pizza,Thin-crusted and baked to the perfection. A great pre-sunset program is to walk down there from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. Waiting lines are common out front.
"September 6, 2013",40,No disappointment,"When we decided to go we had really high expectations for the place. Our friends told us that the line is long to get a table, but it's totally worth it. AND it was !!! The pizza was delicious!"
"August 27, 2013",40,Good and big pizza!,"Good and big pizza. Also the price is reasonable. You can pay only cash, no credit card! And you have to do a very long line!"
"August 26, 2013",40,excellent & fresh ingridients,"I though that when it is so famous it will be bad or very bad - and for turists. It was very good. The ingredients were fresh, nicely matched. Very tasty. Worth visiting. Quickly served."
"August 25, 2013",50,Fun experience!,A great place to visit if you are in the Brooklyn Bridge Park area. There was a line about 15 minutes before it opened. We're seated and served quickly . They are brought our drinks right away. This was a unique eating experience!

"August 15, 2013",50,NY Pizza,"This is the truth, nothing but the true NY pizza. The ambiance is not the same as the old Grimaldi's, but what matters is the pizza, and it is still the same!"
"August 12, 2013",40,Grimaldis,Great pizza but the line was long at 8:30 didnt get in until 9:20 and pizza by 9:50. Prices for pizza are great. Quality ingredients.
"August 7, 2013",20,Surly Service,This was my second visit to Grimaldi's Pizzeria in two years...and once again I found the pizza to be average and the service to be surly. Why they is usually a wait is beyone me.
"August 4, 2013",50,Brooklyn Pizza,"Amazing pizza. So simple, yet perfect. 600 degree coal fired ovens bakes your pizza in 3 minutes. Thin crispy crust, but still firm enough to fold and eat. Literally 100 people in line!! (Tip: Take the Brookly Pizza tour, and skip the line)"
"July 30, 2013",50,Best Pizza Ever!,"This is a ""Must"" go to pizzeria while in New York City. We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge then we had the Best Pizza. My son had seen it on the Food Network Channel so we had to find it, and I'm glad we did!"
"July 24, 2013",50,Delicious Pizza!,The pizza was delicious and priced right. Do yourself a favour and take a trip to Brooklyn. DELICIOUS!
"July 4, 2013",30,We waited how long for cardboard?,The pizza her is just not worth the hassle to taxi over from Manhattan.too thin and to be honest the biggest let down of my trip.
"July 4, 2013",50,Best Pizza ever!,The restaurant was located right under the Brooklyn bridge. Really cool place to eat traditional New York pizza. It was worth the trip there. The pizza was so good. Fresh made Mozzarella cheese-everything Seemed fresh-not packaged. Pizza at home will never be as good now!
"June 29, 2013",40,"Great pizza, if you are in the neighborhood.","After the Brooklyn bridge walking tour, we ate here. A little bit of a wait but worth it. No thrills but A/C was nice. Would not come all the way from Manhattan just to visit the place."
"June 25, 2013",50,OMG!!!!! BEST PIZZA EVER!,"This I was some amazing pizza! I wish I could have packed this pizzeria in my suitcase and taken it home with me! The pizzas are cooked on a coal heated brick oven. The big pizza chains like Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa John's...ect"

"June 10, 2013",40,Great pizza,Waiting line but it went quickly and service was fast for pizza too. Fun location in Dumbo under the Brooklyn Bridge. Restaurant was very crowded though and warm. It was a very hot day outside.
"May 30, 2013",30,Not worth the wait.,"Mysteriously, to me, there is always a long line waiting for seating at Grimaldis. As Brooklyn Heights residents, we braved it once and wouldn't again. The pizza we sampled was average."

"May 26, 2013",30,Good tourist attraction,"It was very good but the food and line did not live up to the hype. There was a 45 minute wait (outside), limited menu and good food (not great food). The location under the Brooklyn Bridge is fun and we enjoyed the experience."
"May 22, 2013",50,Best pizza,"Yum! Biggest yummiest pizza ever! Washed down with their house wine. Cosy atmosphere, no frills. Worth a visit"
"May 20, 2013",40,Service is terrible but pizza is simply THE BEST,"Don't come here for great service. Come here for great pizza. And then after, walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to work off that yummy finger licking goodness that is Grimaldi's pizza."
"May 20, 2013",50,Real NY pizza,"This is some of the best pizza I have ever had and I am born and raised a New Yorker. They use fresh mozzarella, homemade sauce and the crust must be made with that famous NY water because it is simply delectable."
"May 20, 2013",50,"Best pizza, fun atmosphere","I had a good experience here late on a weeknight. After walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, we were tired and hungry. We got right in and the pizza came quickly. It was wonderful and went great with a Brooklyn lager."

"May 7, 2013",50,NY Staple,Great this crust coal pizza. so classic and fresh. Such a great experience every time I go. Delicious!
"May 7, 2013",30,Not worth the wait,"Even before the move and the loss of their famous coal oven, Grimaldi's has long been overrated. After the original owners sold it, the pizza has been inconsistent and never spectacular. Waiting on those long lines for average pizza is insane."
"April 30, 2013",40,Classic,The pizza and location are great. I stopped by on a walking tour of New York/Brooklyn and it was timely and tasty. Prices are reasonable for a bite to eat at a historic pizza joint.
"April 25, 2013",50,Amazing!,"Worth the wait :). Just across the Brooklyn bridge which we walked; best pizza ever with homemade tomatoe sauce and fresh ingr√©dients, cooked in coal brick-oven. we loved it!"

"April 9, 2013",40,A lot of pizza for your money.,"Really good pizza at this place. We ordered to small pizza's. One each, it was really way til much for us. Good value."
"April 8, 2013",30,"New York's best pizza institution, now tragically compromised","A year ago, this was the best pizza joint in the city. The energy was electric and the pizza was amazing. When they moved next door, something was lost. What a tragedy. The pizza might taste the same, but the experience has changed forever."
"April 6, 2013",40,authentic NY pizza,"Nestled under the Brooklyn Bridge, Grimaldi's offers a great NY-style pizza at a fair price. We enjoyed a couple of great pies, then walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to revel in the Manhattan skyline at night. Not a bad way to spend an evening."
"April 5, 2013",50,This is the real deal.,"We enjoyed a tremendous pie. Sauce made of crushed imported Italian tomatoes...fresh slices of mozzarella...delicious Italian sausage...and a crust straight from heaven. It lives up to the hype, and is worth the wait. No slices, no credit cards, no delivery. Just great pizza."
"April 3, 2013",50,Well worth the wait!,"We picked a chilly night to stand in line, but it was worth it! Wonderful pizza, perfect crust. The wine is good too."
"April 3, 2013",40,"GREAT PIZZA, GREAT LOCATION","I strongly recommend this restaurant while you visit Brooklyn. The pizza is good and the service quite good as well. You have to share table, but it was no problem as long as you are confortable with it."
"April 1, 2013",50,Best Pizza,"Get there early and avoid the always present line. The white pizza was fantastic. Atmosphere is so so, but the pies are unbelievable."

"March 26, 2013",50,Worht the wait.,"Get there early or at least at a off time for dining. Great food, cash only no cards. Pizza was heavenly."
"March 25, 2013",40,Great find!,"We stumbled on this place as tourists, and were very impressed! No long lines when we went (late lunch) and still lots of excellent choices of slices. It was by far the best pizza we had in NY. We'll definitely go back."
"March 12, 2013",50,Delcious!,I thought this maybe one of those of places where the reviews are great but you go there and the pizza is average. wrong. super delicious pizza. pricey though but worth the price
"March 4, 2013",50,Outstanding pizza!,Awesome pizza place located just under the Brooklyn Bridge. One of the best pizzas we've ever had. A must visit while in NY. It's very nice also to walk by the river after dinning at Grimaldi's.

"January 30, 2013",40,Better than expected!,"Pizza was pretty good! The pies are doughier, and not as crispy as some of the other places I tried. The pizza was very cheesy, and was better than I expected!"
"January 19, 2013",30,I was shocked when I saw a long line in front of the restaurant,"Dont know how they do it, but the line was long .Not impressed with the pizza,It's not worth to wait"
"January 18, 2013",30,Blah.,"The only thing impressive here is the location. Not impressed with the pizza or the service. Rude would be a good word to describe they treatment we received. Pricey, too! Don't bother, there's too many other better pizza places in NYC."
"January 4, 2013",30,OK pizza and atmosphere,"The pizza is OK, but it isn't worth the cab fare to come from Manhattan across the bridge for a pizza. So much for listening to locals."
"January 1, 2013",50,"No cards, no slices","Old school pizzeria under the Brooklyn bridge, things are simple in this place. The pizza are originally named and HUGE. The places is usually packed and seating is first come, first serve. The pizzas are good and the atmosphere authentic."
"December 29, 2012",40,Very good,Enjoyed the pizza at Grimaldi's. Fresh ingredients and good crust. The line was long so go BEFORE you are hungry. Tried the white pizza which was good but very garlicky and the traditional pizza with italian sausage which was also good.
"December 28, 2012",50,Great Tasty Pie.,"The Line is out the door. so try to get there earlier because you'll be standing on line waiting for quite some time. Great pizza, more pricey than your average pie but very good."

"December 17, 2012",40,winner,"we've been to grimaldi's all over the country -- scottsdale, dallas, foirt myers and highlands, nj -- all offer great pies brooklyn original is an experience with lines outside on cold days and festival seating in the middle -- still cool and worth going"
"December 17, 2012",40,Best Pizza in the Neighborhood,"Under new management. Patsy Grimaldi sold the spot and has a new place nearby. Coal oven means crisp crust. Fresh ingredients, good red sauce. Tasty crust. Bit on the heavy side. Price is right."
"December 16, 2012",30,Great pizza but poor service,"Visited it here in December, we were in a group of 7. We were seated quickly and the pizza was probably one of the best I have ever tasted, however the service was bad and really ruined the experience."
"December 16, 2012",50,By far the Best,"If you want to taste the best pizza in the world, then you MUST go here PERIOD! Enough said. Pay whatever they ask, who cares, it is the best pizza ever."
"December 14, 2012",40,Worth the wait!,We waited about 45 minutes outside and some more inside...but hey...if it's great who cares. It was ! The sinatra dude was singing up a storm and the pizza..unforgettable!
"December 13, 2012",40,Worth the trip!,"The pizza here was great, we had to wait a while to get in and the service was a little spotty, but it was a fun night out with some good pie."
"December 13, 2012",40,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Pizza was good, but not as good as I expected. Made fresh which you can watch from your table. Fair prices"
"December 13, 2012",30,not worth the wait,Lines are definitely too long and the pizza is okay compared to Front Street Pizza which is only 2 blocks away.
"December 5, 2012",20,Thriving on its reputation (disappointing),Rude staff and pretty ordinary pizza. It's one those places that still lives on because it used to be good and is still in the guide books. If you are staying in Manhattan it is not worth the trek.
"December 3, 2012",50,Best pizza in NYC!,"Really like the new location. Hasn't changed quality of pizza! Always worth the wait in line! Service was a little slower compared to last visit, but it was nice to not feel rushed out of the restaurant."
"November 30, 2012",30,The pizza is great... but,"it is not worth the lines. This is New York, it is not hard to find spectacular pizza. No need to wait in line on the sidewalk, just explore the neighborhood!"
"November 26, 2012",20,Nothing special,I think the good reviews have gone to the owner¬¥s head as his rudeness is truly breathtaking. Pizzas were average. Worth it if you are in the area and want a pizza but don¬¥t go out of your way for it.
"November 19, 2012",50,Love the original,We love Grimaldis in San Antonio. And waited in line for the original. And it was awesome. The whole experience is worth the effort and the staff and the coal fired pizza met every expectation. Much happiness!
"November 10, 2012",50,In the point of view of a twelve year old,This is by far the best pizzeria in New York it's a true brooklyn jem. If you're visiting New York and you want a genuine New York experience I'd would go here immediately.
"November 10, 2012",50,pizza like I remember,"Coal fired,fresh mozzarella,thin crust,pizza I have yearned for since I was a kid growing up in little Italy. Their regular entrees are pretty good also,good size portions."
"October 29, 2012",50,Best Pizza I Ever Had!,Quite honestly the best pizza I have ever had in my life! Worth queuing outside for and totally worth the wait! Exceptional!
"October 22, 2012",40,Good pizza but not the best,No wait in line. Ordered two different pizzas and they were good but not the best. Service is average with no personality. Tables are close and intimate but generally clean. Would not wait over 20 mins for it.
"October 18, 2012",50,Worth the trek and the wait.,"Brilliant! This place is amazing value and the pizza was just fantastic. Light, fresh ingredients... worth the ride to Brooklyn."
"October 18, 2012",50,"Delicious pizza, worth the wait!","This place can have quite the waiting line, but it is worth it. The pizza is delicious (thin crust, fresh mozzarella) and the atmosphere is charming. I would highly recommend eating here and then walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. It was a fantastic experience!"
"October 18, 2012",50,Very good Pizza,We visitied the Douglaston location. Salad and Pizza were great. Service was a bit slow but it seemed they may have been short the night went. I have been a few times and normally the service is better.
"October 15, 2012",50,Best Pizza Yum,Went at around 4.30 Place was busy Got a large between us and added more toppings to it Was the best Service good too
"October 15, 2012",30,Good Pizza nothing Special,We called in an order and did take out to avoid the long lines. The Pizza was good but nothing special.
"October 14, 2012",50,Excellent coal fired oven pizza under the Brooklyn Bridge,"Excellent pizza with a thin, crisp crust and fresh mozzarella. Service was perfect. Prices are very reasonable. This pizza is worth the trip. Note that Grimaldi's does not take credit cards so bring cash."
"October 12, 2012",50,45 Mins wait outside for the best Pizza Ever,"Simple & superb, probably the best Pizza we have ever had. Very Limited menu, but what was on offer was excellent. Cash only accepted which may have been a problem if we hadn't had enough with us."
"October 7, 2012",30,Not really worth the wait,"Good pizza... if you get there right when it opens. With so many good places around, it's definitely not worth waiting hours to get a pie."
"October 6, 2012",40,Consistently good,"Been in march & September 2012 and both visits were a treat.. Great buzz about the place, cheery staff and great pizza... NYCs best pizza? Just maybe...."
"October 6, 2012",40,Great food with a little attitude,When you have to wait in line just to order take out must mean something. The pizza was amazing but the guy taking take out orders was pissy.
"September 30, 2012",50,Best Pizza In The World,"Last time my wife and I had this was 3 years ago. When we went back last week, didn't change my mind that Grimaldi's is still the best pizza in the world!!!"
"September 30, 2012",30,Mezzo-mezzo pie,OK pie. Too long a line. Too many tourists in that line. Better to find a local pizza joint without the cachet.
"September 20, 2012",40,so good. But not good enough for that line,"I used to go all the time, but the line of tourists reached epic propotions and the quality is not quite what it once was."
"September 17, 2012",20,At least its cheap and the line moved quickly,We had to try it because you know - its Grimaldi's. We could have gotten a better meal just about anywhere. The pizza was bland and the service was indifferent but at least it was inexpensive. Dont' bother.
"September 15, 2012",10,Avoid,Not worth waiting on line for. A tourist trap. There are so many more authentic NYC pizza places and this one isn't it. Try Keste's instead. It's in Greenwich Village.
"September 3, 2012",40,Delicious and very good value,The location is a bit tricky to get to and the queue is long but well worth it. The pizzas are delicious and the staff is nice. The prices are also very reasonable. Well worth a visit!
"September 2, 2012",40,"great location,fun experience","quite good pizza, best is location below bridge, and peeking at celebrity photos on walls (drawbacks, limited menu, ok service, crowded)"
"August 29, 2012",30,NYC beloved Pizza?,"Taking order took too long, about 10 minutes. Stuff is unfriendly and seems to be uninterested. Pizza was tasty."
"August 26, 2012",40,Worth the Wait?,There is ALWAYS a line. Great pizza but there is great pizza all around. Only worth the wait if you want to say 'I was there'.
"August 25, 2012",50,Best coal oven pizza,The place was very busy we we only had to wait 20 minutes. The pizza was delicious and the service was efficient. We were not disappointed after all the things we had heard.
"August 22, 2012",50,Good Pizza,The pizza was excellent - portions are massive (this was my first experience of American food to be fair!). The restaurant was busy (with good reason) with service being friendly.
"August 13, 2012",50,Mmmmmmm!!!!,This is absolutely the best pizza I've ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HANDS DOWN
"August 11, 2012",50,Fabulous little spot.,Perfect place for lunch/dinner either before or after you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge (depending on which way you are going to walk)...many celebrities have been seen in there and the pizza is undeniably yummy.
"August 5, 2012",50,Yummy!!,By far the best pizza I ever had!!! Very very tasty and ingredients are fresh....service is also great.....yes sometimes the line is long but worth the wait definitely a must try while in nyc!
"August 4, 2012",50,Unbelievably Good,"Loved the pizza and atmosphere. I believe they have remodeled now to accommodate more patrons. W had to wait about thirty minutes at 11:30 Sunday morning, but it was totally worth it."
"August 3, 2012",40,The Brooklyn Pizza Experience!,"Always so fresh and a classic pizza spot in Brooklyn. Nothing like New York Pizza! It's worth the wait if you don't mind waiting, and remember there is no delivery just pick up and dine in!"
"August 2, 2012",50,Best pizzeria in Brooklyn and probably in New York City!,It is worth the long wait to eat pizza at Grimaldi's! Great ambience and good prices. Totally recommended.

"July 31, 2012",50,Awesome pizza,"The pizzeria is located in a cool neighborhood, great food and then a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge! It's all good!"
"July 29, 2012",50,Real Pizza,We ordered a small pizza to split. I thought they had gotten the order wrong. The small is twice the size of normal large pizza at home. This pizza was the best tasting pizza I have ever eaten.
"July 27, 2012",50,To die for pizza!,The pizza is great! Crust delicious as well. Good service. Ordered the small size and 3 of us shared it. Priced right.
"July 25, 2012",40,Energy after a long walk over the bridge,I waited in a long line in 90 degree heat to eat at this joint. You are seated at a long table with strangers. We ordered a pizza with buffalo mozz! I ate half the pizza myself it was so delish.
"July 23, 2012",50,Worth the Wait,"Even though the line to get in was long, it was worth it. The pizza was delicious. Enjoyed watching the crusts being made while we waited for our food. Service was very prompt."
"July 22, 2012",50,PERFECT PIZZA,we love these pizza it was so exquisite and also we think it's cheap. DUMBO where the pizzeria it's located it's and excellent place because you can see brooklyn and manhattan bridge. It's a really nice seaport.

"July 16, 2012",40,So Good!,Delicious! Worth the wait and the calories. Best pizza I ever ate.
"July 16, 2012",40,Very good authentic NY style pizza,"Visited Grimaldi's from out of town. My daughter took us there -- she lives in Brooklyn. I was looking for authentic NY style pizza. Grimaldi's was what I was looking for. Crowded, long line, etc., but the pizza was very good. Memorable."
"July 15, 2012",50,Best Pizza in New York!,"Great pizza! Usually a wait, but we got in pretty quick! There's a good time to get in but you'll have to figure that out yourself! This is a must, especially after walking off the Brooklyn Bridge!"
"July 10, 2012",50,Awesome pizza,"No news. The long line and hour wait just to be seated says it all. The pizza is the best! and once you are seated, the pizza will be in front of you in no time at all. Fresh, delicious pizza."
"July 10, 2012",40,Tasty Pizza w/ atmosphere,Standard pizza fare. Recently re-located from down the street. Sitting in the front we were able to watch the pies being made Good soft drinks from Brooklyn. Service good--famous reputation.
"July 10, 2012",50,AWESOME...,There is a reason there is a line down the sidewalk outside this Brooklyn pizzeria. The pizza is the best I have had in the U.S. Only Italy is better than this.
"July 9, 2012",40,Good Pizza!,"The wait is long, sometimes very long but its a classic Brooklyn Pizzeria that can be worth the wait on a nice day. Inside is small and not fancy but the pizza is good and is cooked in a coal brick oven."
"June 28, 2012",50,Awesome!,Loved the pizza and the history of the place. I recommend you get there early to avoid huge lines. We walked the Brooklyn Bridge back to wear off our delicious pizza!
"June 25, 2012",40,Great flavor,Really good pizza but not worth the wait the second time around.
"June 24, 2012",50,Best pizza in town!,"Take a morning to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, from Manhattan to Brooklyn, and then reward yourself with a real italian pizza. Have in mind that you will probably have to make a line...the place is always full!"
"June 22, 2012",30,Lotsa good pizza in NYC,"Line's too long, not so stand out that it's worth the wait."
"June 22, 2012",40,Worth the wait!,We discovered Grimaldi's whilst walking to the Brooklyn Bridge. Wow ... What a pleasant surprise. Waited for 45 minutes in the queue and an additional 45 minutes for our pizzas (it was lunchtime Saturday). Simple yet awesomely tasty pizzas. Lovely Italian ambiance.
"June 15, 2012",50,Best pizza on the planet,"Best pizza on the planet. If you don't try this. Well, you wont have the best pizza on the planet"
"June 14, 2012",50,Best Pizza I've Ever Had,Walked here from the Brooklyn Bridge. Well worth the wait with the lunch crowd. Best pizza i've ever had!! Prices were reasonable and the food came really quick. Met some locals as well and got some great sight seeing tips and ideas.
"June 12, 2012",40,Best Pizza!!,My kids and I ended up outside of Grimaldi's and decided to go in for pizza. We were not dissapointed. The smell of pizza and the oven brick stove were wonderful!!. Staff was nice as well!
"June 9, 2012",50,Fantastic Pizza,"Went here on the Brooklyn Pizza tour, the pizza was fantastic, well worth a visit."
"June 8, 2012",50,Best pizza I've ever eaten.,This pizza was awesome. The crust was perfect and they were not stingy with the toppings. We tried the white pizza which had just the right amount of garlic and seasonings. The pepperoni pizza was equally as great. Too bad they don't deliver to TN!!!
"June 6, 2012",30,Just OK,"I think its become a little touristy!!! Pizza was good but was it because we were starving........ ? Restaurant was busy, not sure if I would make the effort to go again."
"May 28, 2012",50,Worth the wait,"Great brick oven pizza! Plan to wait about 45 minutes - 1 hour to be seated. Make sure to bring cash, as they do not accept credit cards."
"May 28, 2012",40,Long line outside but great pizza,"The pizza is excellent and the line, although long, moved fairly quickly. You can burn some of the calories off by walking to the restaurant via the Brooklyn Bridge. If you in lower Manhattan the walk is doable and the views outstanding."
"May 28, 2012",40,From Brooklyn to Arizona,After moving to Arizona I was glad to see Grimald's Pizzeria. They bring in all the ingredients from back east. In 5 years I have not found a pizza place that comes close to Grimaldi's in Arizona.
"May 24, 2012",20,Not worth waiting for!,You can find better pizza in many other places! Not worth waiting for!
"May 22, 2012",50,Best pizza!,Pizza made fresh in a brick oven. The wait is 45 min to 1 hour. Try the white pizza with basil.
"May 19, 2012",50,"Good pizza, long wait.","Like the great pizza places of New Haven, you will wait at Grimaldi's. However, a must on the Brooklyn pizza tour."
"May 18, 2012",40,The right place at the right time.....with pizza!,"Great pizza in a perfect location beneath the Brooklyn Bridge, and the food was good ,too."
"May 7, 2012",40,Great Pizza!,"We ordered takeout and they had delicious pizza! Nice and thin, not overly greasy, and not too salty. Everything was just right! Well worth the wait (if you have time)!"

"May 6, 2012",50,mmmmm Pizzzaaaaaa!,Was there a line? Yes. Did we wait long? 70 Minutes. Was it worth it ? YES
"May 5, 2012",30,big deal?,"its very good pizza, but today its like alot of other brick over pizza places and doesnt rate extremely high on my list."
"May 5, 2012",40,Coal brick oven pizza goodness,"Good pizza! The char it gets from the coal brick oven adds a different flavor profile that you don't get often. Priced reasonably well, too."
"April 29, 2012",50,A Great Vibe and Good Pizza,"As always, the queue. Did our 45 min+ wait and had a great lunch. A very special place to visit with fantastic pizza. A very good vibe amongst diners."
"April 28, 2012",40,yummy pizza,"something a bit different to the usual by-the-slice fare in the city. nice pizza, quick service."
"April 24, 2012",50,Awesome Pizza,"You might have to wait in line for a short bit but the pizza is well worth the wait. If the weather is nice, walk back across the Brooklyn Bridge afterwards. The views are incredible and you can walk off some of the calories!"
"April 21, 2012",40,Good pizza in NYC!,"I'm Italian, so I tend to be very strict when it comes to pizzerias abroad, but this was very, very nice!"
"April 15, 2012",30,Other better choices in Brooklyn,"You have to buy an entire pie, no slices. To me their pizza is dry and rubbery."
"April 13, 2012",40,great pie,worth the wait---- I can't wait to try it in the new location
"April 3, 2012",30,The outside line doesn't equal the best pizza but it is good,"Good but just not worth the long wait both outside and inside-1.5 hour and half for one pizza and very hot inside, get a fan with all the money they make."
"April 3, 2012",30,I have had better,"Always crowded, but not worth the wait. Totonno's in Coney Island blows this place out of the water."
"April 3, 2012",30,Average,"They serve a good pizza, but their pizza was as good as my local pizzeria! I didn't have to line up but I don't think it's worth the wait if there's a long queue to get in."
"April 2, 2012",30,Don't worth the waiting time,"The guy who is the hostess is a very stupid old man, and we waited like 1 hour to have the pizza wicha was just normal.."
"April 2, 2012",30,Pretty Good,"The pizza was pretty good, but it wasn't good enough for me to wait 30-40 minutes outside in line again. I would eat there again if I didn't have to wait. The service was great though. Warm, friendly and efficient."
"March 28, 2012",30,Not all its cracked up to be,"Heard a lot about this place; the famous people whom have eaten their but we found it very average. Pizza was huge and value for money, but don't go if you have great expectations."
"March 25, 2012",40,New location,Grimaldi's has moved up the street to #1 Front St. They open at Noon. We waited in line and didn't regret it. We thought the pizza was great and our service was good. They don't sell slices and they only take cash.
"March 19, 2012",50,Worth the wait,"One of the best pizzas I've ever eaten! We had to wait about half an hour to get seated and then about another half hour for our pizza, but it was worth it!"
"March 14, 2012",50,Don't wait on line ! Call ahead,Do your a big favor and call ahead 20-30 mins before you go to order a pie. This way you can walk in and grab your pie and not wait on line with all the tourist and hipsters waiting for a slice/pie..........................
"March 14, 2012",40,Good Pizza,"Great pizza, not to expensive. Neat atmosphere. Wait staff I would not say is very friendly. But great pizza."
"March 13, 2012",40,VERy good,"VEry VERY good pizza, but I still do not think its as great as its hype. It doesn't really differentiate itself from the other great brick oven pizzas in the neighborhood."
"March 12, 2012",30,Over rated trap,"Go to Luigi's on 5th ave and 21st St. in Brooklyn and get the special with the fresh mozzarella and the pesto,basil sauce."
"March 10, 2012",40,Good Pizza,You have to wait on line and the seating is a bit close but the Pie is worth it!!
"March 7, 2012",50,Delicious,A great location and delicious thin crust pizza. Sometimes there is a line so if you go at lunch time don't go too hungry.
"February 29, 2012",30,Hype about Grimaldi's,It was just OK. Pizza is pizza. There was no line for a change so we were in quick.
"February 27, 2012",50,Oh my delicious,"Grimaldi's has the best thin crust pizza I have ever tasted. They also are very accommodating to their guests. The food it great, the people are great, and you will leave super full!"
"February 26, 2012",50,Totally worth the wait,Just go and dont ask question until after you eat! Standing in line might not seem worth while but in the end you will be so glad that you did! Enjoy the area afterwards!
"February 25, 2012",30,Disappointing.,The hype around Grimaldi's prompted us to walk from the subway to the Brooklyn location. The pizza was just ok. The sauce was good. Mozzarella was dry and tasteless. Crust was ok. There are other pizza places that are better.
"March 10, 2012",10,"Didn't even get a bite to eat""",They threw us out! We asked for a table for six - four of us were in the restaurant and two of us 50 meters away outside. A very arrogant man showed us out and made us wait behind a certain line. I have never...More
"March 7, 2012",50,Delicious,A great location and delicious thin crust pizza. Sometimes there is a line so if you go at lunch time don't go too hungry.
"March 5, 2012",30,You go there for the pizza ‚Äîyou don't come back because of the service,"The pizza was great, but the service wasn't at the same level. There was a russian waiter who was very rude and disrespectful. Honestly, I don't understand what he's doing serving in a restaurant because he's disgusting. The wine was too warm, the waiters were clueless but the pizza was awesome. A pity."
"March 2, 2012",40,Best pizza's around,Really atmospheric run-down old bank pretty much under the ramps to Brookyn Bridge at no1 Front st.  High quality juicy pizzas with an emphasis on marscapone which makes them really succulent. A good value pitcher of house red to go with your pizza and you're made!  High quality furniture shops nearby for a good browse at the right time of day plus the unforgettable experience of walking under Manhattan bridge as trains THUNDER across. People live here?!!
"February 29, 2012",30,Hype about Grimaldi's,It was just OK. Pizza is pizza. There was no line for a change so we were in quick.

"February 26, 2012",50,Fantastic Pies,"1st time trying the pies at Grimaldi's have heard a lot of great things about the pizza and it was all true. They only take cash but the prices are very reasonable. I spent $30 for a pie, 3 drinks and tip. Parking is a little tricky but I found a spot. Already planning to dine here again next time I'm in NYC"
"February 25, 2012",30,Disappointing.,The hype around Grimaldi's prompted us to walk from the subway to the Brooklyn location. The pizza was just ok. The sauce was good. Mozzarella was dry and tasteless. Crust was ok. There are other pizza places that are better.
"February 23, 2012",10,Pizza from Sinatra's youth might have drawn crowds to this famous place or was it because he was there?,"Pizza from Sinatra's youth might have drawn crowds to this famous place or was it because he was there? Today, his photos cover the walls but sadly the pizza is not great, the service is poor and it still draws unsuspecting tourists, like us, so beware...this is not a good pizza restaurant and I can always trust my best critic...my stomach ...which did not take too long to prove my point....hardly worth the trip to Brooklyn for this hugely over-rated joint."
"February 19, 2012",50,Best pizza!,I loved the pizza here...walk over the Brooklyn bridge and have a feast! get a taxi back because you wont be able to move afterwards!
"February 9, 2012",50,Its own addictive flavor,"I don't know what kind of fairy dust they sprinkle on their pizzas, but they have an addictive flavor. We eat at Grimaldis once or twice a month."
"January 26, 2012",50,Neat,The best end to a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge ever!
"January 18, 2012",30,OVER RATED but the pizza isnt bad,OVER RATED but the pizza isnt bad. Dont understand what all the fuss is about.
"January 15, 2012",40,Great Pizza,Probably the best brick oven in Brooklyn. Worth the wait on line.
"January 15, 2012",30,Long wait time but good food,Good Food was there a few years ago. When i went i had a long wait but the food is good.
"January 12, 2012",40,Awesome pizza!,The pizza here is really good. I love thin crust and the slices are pretty big. The sauce is excellent also. The service was not bad for a busy time. I would eat here many times again!
"January 10, 2012",50,BRICK OVEN BABY!!!,Find me a better slice in NYC- YOU CAN'T!!!.......................................................
"January 8, 2012",50,Good Old time Pizza,You will need to fight for your food but it is worth it. The parking and the wait are rough but the pizza is original.
"January 6, 2012",50,Go there now!!,Simply awesome!! Only had to wait about 20 mins and it was well worth it. Its moved just up the road into a new buliding that has a lot of character. Go a large between 2 people and use your hands!!
"January 5, 2012",50,The best Pizza around,This was the best Pizza I have ever tasted. I never believed people when they say you haven't had pizza until you've had NY pizza. I'm a believer now!
"January 4, 2012",50,Still best pizza! And better new location:),We've been regular for at least 5 years! It's never a disappointment. Always great! And huge line is a confirmation to that. Can't imagine new york without it.
"December 28, 2011",20,"Terrible service, decent pizza, overpriced","Waited 1.5 hrs.. Only to be greeted by rude serive. Inbuilt gratitude, but didn't state it on bill properly (4 ppl). I wouldn't even bother.."
"December 27, 2011",30,Lines can be out the door,"Is it the best -- it's very good, had better. Like Patricia's in Williamsburg better and you're not rushed."
"December 26, 2011",50,Best ever!,My family made the trek from Manhattan just for this pizza. It was certainly worth the trip. We split a pepperoni and fresh garlic pie. Delicious would be an understatement. We will come back here beery time we go to New York.
"December 17, 2011",50,One of my favorites,"Yes, you have to wait outside in a line. But the wait is worth it! They have excellent pizza and reasonably priced house wine. Walk back to Manhattan across the Brooklyn Bridge to burn off those calories!"
"December 15, 2011",40,Authentic & tasty,Great pizza at a fairly popular pizzeria. Great experience and nice stop after walking the Brooklyn Bridge. A bit on the $$ side for pizza.

"November 28, 2011",50,What is the attraction?,"The pizza is good but then in Brooklyn most pizza is good. I don't understand why it is so popular with visitors to New York. But good luck to them, it's not a rip off and it is a good place for lunch."
"November 28, 2011",10,2 hour wait for so-so pizza,"Pizza was ok, not bad at all, but a two hour wait? Ridiculous that a pick up order has to wait as long as a sit down. Also dismaying to wait for hours and see a tour group breeze past you."

"November 2, 2011",20,Not sure it was worth the wait?!?,"Staff quite arrogant so service wasn't what I had expected given that everyone in the restaurant seemed to be a tourist, no banter, no pleasantries, just took order, food dropped and then took money, quite disappointing really."
"October 18, 2011",30,Good pizza but don't think it's worth the wait ..,We stood in a line outside the pizzeria for an hour and half to eat pretty good pizza. It definitely didn't knock my socks off - may be it was the hour and half wait that dimmed my taste buds?

"May 3, 2011",40,Great NYC Pizza,This place has been around for years and really does have great brick oven pizza. Take a walk over the Brooklyn bridge from the Manhattan side. Great views on the way and a cold beer and good pizza under the bridge. Remember cash only.
