"November 3, 2018",50,Friendly service and good range of meat and fish dishes,Iiimpar is a great restaurant towards the top end of the Lisbon range and was busy even early on.

"November 2, 2018",40,Nice but not top class,When you visit a restaurant at this level you expect some quality. Beef in a bowl of sauce with fried egg on top isn‚Äôt what you expect and looks really tragic. Fish dishes are instead real good and are the reason of 4 stars in our review.

"July 26, 2018",50,Service and food excellent,"Decided to give this restaurant a go after seeing some of the reviews on trip advisor and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Firstly, the service was absolutely first class. We were served by Patricia who was passionate about the food and gave great recommendations, as well as being attentive throughout (along with the other staff). We had the Iberian pork and rib eye steak, which flavour wise beat comparable dishes we‚Äôve had in the past. The fried ice cream for dessert was something different and highly recommended.

"July 22, 2018",50,Great find in Lisbon!,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and was recommended by the concierge to visit this restaurant - we were not disappointing!  Came for dinner this week after a long day of sightseeing, was a perfect end to the day. It's a small restaurant with a calm and relaxing atmosphere. When we first came it was not very busy but slowly got very busy. Many locals were coming which is always a good sign.  The service was very friendly and attentive, with helpful recommendations from our waiter. There is something for everyone. We had grilled sea bass, salted cod and Portuguese style steak which was fantastic! The desserts are also not to be missed - we tried the fried ice cream and walnut cake with passion fruit and berry sorbet which was lovely! We all agreed was the best meal we had in Lisbon. Do visit if you are in the avenue liberdade area."
"July 21, 2018",50,Lovely Evening,"We got a babysitter for our little one and the wife and I took a meal here.  It was a Wednesday evening and the place was fairly quiet.  Staff is friendly, manager present and vibes are super friendly.  We ordered a bottle of local wine (great value for money) and 2 steaks + sides.  Steaks were great cuts of meat and grilled over charcoal I believe - super tasty anyway.  Deep fried ice cream for dessert was a winner.  Simple menu - well executed."
"July 17, 2018",40,A lot of laughter,"The food and service here were terrific, but what I remember most was the laughter. Everyone was having a great time. The little girl at the table next to us spilled her water and the waiter dealt with it in a friendly and effificent way."
"July 13, 2018",50,Worth the time and money,"Great food. For starters, we had the quail which was flavorful. Only complaint is quail is boney which is no fault of restaurant. Entrees were Octopus, which we never had and found it very tasty. And steak which was cooked correctly for medium and full of flavor. For dessert we had the fried ice cream. I could have licked the plate but cannot in public! Staff was attentive and reasonable prices including wine. Would,definitely go again if in Lisbon."

Arriving at 9.50 pm we went and a table for four was quickly set up and I must say the staff were terrific, they were delightful and very welcoming.  The restaurant I believe had opened at the beginning of March and it should go from strength to strength on our experience of that evening. We really enjoyed the food and wine we selected and would certainly recommend IIIMPAR to any of our friends who were visiting Lisbon.

And a special thanks to Sergio and Juan who were very helpful to us."

"August 31, 2019",50,Service and food blew us away.,"From the moment we walked in and were greeted as old friends, till the very end, when we were bursting at the seams trying to cram down just ooone more bite of the vanilla ice cream with the silky caramel sauce, BYF delivered in spades.  The head waiter, Roberto, made us feel as if were regulars and gave us the best advice on how to enjoy our BYF experience. The Amarela red Alentejo wine was sparkling and bright; it started the night off on the right foot. From then on, we started off with Mussels and provolone cheese; the former being the biggest I‚Äôd ever seen in my life, with a sauce that was unforgettable.  Followed by the massive TBone steak weighing in at more than 3/4 of a kilo, juicy and succulent; the meat melting in our mouths with every bite. Accompanied by the mashed sweet potatoes, creamier and silkier than Naomi Campbell after a bubble bath. This is the wine talking.  I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. It‚Äôs in the heart of Saldanha and it‚Äôs not pricey, but it‚Äôs not cheap either. 2 starters, a bottle of great Portuguese red, a massssive hunk of melt in your mouth beef and a huge serving of dessert set us back about ‚Ç¨100 (including the 10% service charge).  This was the highlight of our 10 day visit to Lisbon. We will definitely be coming back soon!  Thank you Roberto!"

Their forte is meat, steaks etc, and it blew us away. The food is incredible, and the prices are the same, if not cheaper than those at the big 'food market' across the road. It's really intimate too, as it only seats around 28 people. I would suggest booking if you want to secure an actual table on the weekend, otherwise they usually have seats available at the bar even on weekends, which as a couple, I found even better because you get to watch these amazing chefs at work. The staff were really attentive and even though it was busy, they were always there to top a glass, have a quick chat or clear finished courses.  You cannot leave without trying their desserts either, the crumble is to die for! And the lemon grass creme brulee is a fresh and delicious take on the classic. As Australians, we felt very unpatriotic not getting the pavolva but saw it delivered to another table and regretted our decision even further."
"July 16, 2015",50,A very good surprise...,"A small room close to Cais do Sodr√© & Ribeira hosts one of the best surprises we recently had. Original menu, good service, excellent steaks with chosen sauces and dips, Original, different, pleasant!"
"July 8, 2015",40,We liked this original place,"We came across this quite small, but original Restaurant when walking around at Cais do Sodr√©. We had one of the best beef Carpaccio since a long time in and around Lisbon. As main a tasty Entrec√¥te - almost rare - and a wonderful dessert - some sorbet with meringue - but don't remember the name. Everything served with a fresh white wine and on top of it at really reasonable prices. The service was very friendly. The only a bit more negative part is that they are cooking inside the restaurant itself - which is really original specially when you are sitting at the counter - but somehow our clothes smelled food afterwards as well as it was too hot inside. All-in-one, definitely a place to be recommended."

"October 29, 2014",40,THE meat place,they really know how to do meat.They dry age their own ribeye. Had a steakone day and a burger on another day. Absolutely outstanding.Weather permitting try to sit outsiode-a terrace in a romantic setting.

"October 17, 2014",50,"It's true, you don't usually find beef this good in Europe","Out of the way, on the backside of the Principe Real boutique 'mall' so we stumbled upon it. Had a fantastic ribeye with crispy fried potato wedges, a nice salad and a surprise chimichurri. Nice glass of red wine. All inexpensive, friendly staff, nice place....More"
"October 15, 2014",50,"Great place, great meat, great atmosphere","Atalho means butcher, and that should give you an idea what to expect. This is possibly the best place in town to enjoy meat of a quality that is becoming increasingly rare, unfortunately: Properly ripened and properly trimmed cuts of prime animals. The indoor restaurant is placed in a mansion looking like a white Moorish palace out of Arabian Nights. The decor, however, is a very contemporary mixture of rustic and urban chique. The terrace is even lovelier, placed under palm trees in a corner of the Botanical Garden. The place serves excellent cocktails and good coffee, but you should go there for the meat. We had the simplest possible serving: The prego - basically a steak sandwich with no fuss and fancy garniture. Just absolutely excellent beef served in a bun that enhanced the flavour. But there's quite a bit of choice, and you can look at the meat in the kitchen section. The atmosphere is great and the staff very friendly. Highly recommended."
"October 13, 2014",50,Dreamlike terrace,"The quality of the meat is great and the service is friendly (but not flawless). However what really stands our and makes all the minor flows details is the unique environment in the garden. If you were dropped in the outside seating area, blindfolded, you would never have imagined this was central Lisbon, 5 minutes walk from av. Da Liberdade or Bairro Alto. No lounge music - just this great ambience: looking up, an imposing palace, greenery all around and, looking down, a run-down / the-time-stood-still kind of building. Don't miss it on a warm night and book a table outside. My favorite dish is entrec√¥te maturado, but, if you like meat, you'll be pleased with any of the options. Otherwise take the vegetarian burger or a salad - you'll be fine. If you have time, enjoy the action behind the grill in the old kitchen of the palace. It's a show in itself!"
"September 1, 2014",40,Meat lovers,"This place have everything to go well: location & food. Probably better in the summer but with an inside room that we will try for sure when the winter comes. The food it's all about the meat, just go there and have your go, worth it."

We just loved it and will be back!"
"July 30, 2014",40,Under the palms in Princepe Real,"Having frequented the Campo d'ourique setting, time to try this new venue.Its a beautiful locale under the palm trees with a quiet fountain, outdoor tables and big bean bag chairs to flop into. Food was superb beef with options of a bun, or fries, salad or coleslaw. Sirloin steak With coleslaw and fries was delicious. Homemade lemonade and a good bar selection. Desserts were yummy and the locust bean cake with tangerine sorbet was different and tasty. Service is friendly but appeared slow and disorganized. I had to ask for a menu and again ask a waiter to place my order!! It was busy but not out of hand . Nevertheless, I would try again as it might take some time to get a rhythm established. Great relaxing setting , quiet and tranquil."
"July 28, 2014",50,"Best select meat, excellent bar","All the meat at Atalho Real is selected and marbled (just check their kitchen fridge!). A meat lover's paradise. The price is also inexplicably low for meat of this class and the explanation is that the are among the largest importers of meat in Portugal and so the meat they sell at Atalho is select. And do have a drink a the bar, their barwoman is top notch. Booking recommended ."

If you were dropped in the outside seating area, blindfolded, you would never have imagined this was central Lisbon, 5 minutes walk from av. Da Liberdade or Bairro Alto. No lounge music - just this great ambience: looking up, an imposing palace, greenery all around and, looking down, a run-down / the-time-stood-still kind of building. Don't miss it on a warm night and book a table outside. My favorite dish is entrec√¥te maturado, but, if you like meat, you'll be pleased with any of the options. Otherwise take the vegetarian burger or a salad - you'll be fine. If you have time, enjoy the action behind the grill in the old kitchen of the palace. It's a show in itself!"
"September 1, 2014",40,Meat lovers,"This place have everything to go well: location & food. Probably better in the summer but with an inside room that we will try for sure when the winter comes. The food it's all about the meat, just go there and have your go, worth it."

We just loved it and will be back!"
"July 30, 2014",40,Under the palms in Princepe Real,"Having frequented the Campo d'ourique setting, time to try this new venue.Its a beautiful locale under the palm trees with a quiet fountain, outdoor tables and big bean bag chairs to flop into. Food was superb beef with options of a bun, or fries, salad or coleslaw. Sirloin steak With coleslaw and fries was delicious. Homemade lemonade and a good bar selection. Desserts were yummy and the locust bean cake with tangerine sorbet was different and tasty. Service is friendly but appeared slow and disorganized. I had to ask for a menu and again ask a waiter to place my order!! It was busy but not out of hand . Nevertheless, I would try again as it might take some time to get a rhythm established. Great relaxing setting , quiet and tranquil."
"July 28, 2014",50,"Best select meat, excellent bar","All the meat at Atalho Real is selected and marbled (just check their kitchen fridge!). A meat lover's paradise. The price is also inexplicably low for meat of this class and the explanation is that the are among the largest importers of meat in Portugal and so the meat they sell at Atalho is select. And do have a drink a the bar, their barwoman is top notch. Booking recommended ."

"February 6, 2019",10,Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There was no sense of timing. Steaks came out while we were eating salad. The manager pushed the wagyu steak which came out cooked incorrectly after we discussed how we wanted it cooked with the chef and it was nothing like a wagyu steak that I had in Japan. It was the most expensive item on the menu. I doubt it was wagyu imported from Japan as he claimed. The filet was good and reasonably priced. We never received the second glass of wine we ordered. The lighting was like a fast food restaurant. We were planning on a nice relaxing meal, instead we spent a lot of money for 30 mins in a fast food environment.  We live in NYC and travel extensively and eat at steakhouses around the world. I would never go back here! This is not fine dining. It‚Äôs expensive fast food!"
"January 12, 2019",50,A perfect place for steaks&wine,"By weekends, you have to queue here to be seated since it's well-known. Maybe it ain't famous worldwide, but the portions are big, and steaks and other plates are very decent. Besides, you hardly find any place of that kind in France or Germany where you'd pay so little for having so much. For two persons, I have paid 32‚Ç¨, and that was for a fair portion of barbecue, spinach, desert, and a bottle of house wine. Will be back once in Lisbon"

"January 3, 2019",40,The meat makes the wait worth,"You are probably gonna wait to get a seat, but it will worth it. The meat, whichever you select will be top quality and grilled exactly how you ask it.  Besides that, is kind of a soulless place with efficient employees that won't be the best ever but that will make sure that you have your food quickly and efficiently.  I will return and recommend."

"November 28, 2018",40,"Huge portions, share them","Nice and clean restaurant with very good service. You can see the meat before you order it. Portugese cousine is never over spiced and I needed some salt. I left half of my portion of grilled meat with shrimps, atleast 200gram. Chips order separately and there is a selfservice salad to get. At the salad table there are sauces/dips, no dip comes with the meat."

"June 18, 2010",50,The best place we ate in Lisbon! Terrific!,"Our pension recommended this restaurant and we ended up eating here several times during our 5-night stay in Lisbon. It's a grill house and it's affordable and delicious. Other than a few tourists, everyone dining there is local. Every dish we tried was terrific but the absolute favorites included a rack of pork loin wrapped in bacon and green pepper--you get 4 large pieces of pork for about 9 euros. Also the bacalhau of salted cod baked in olive oil and garlic was fabulous for about 12 euros. A salad bar is included with each meal. The atmosphere is friendly, the waiters speak a little English, white table clothes, etc. Two negatives: it's not in the center of Lisbon and the area is not very nice (about a 15 minute walk from the center) and they have two separate menus; one in English and one in Portugese and all the specialities are on the Portugese menu. I'm not sure why they don't have the traditional dishes on the English menu but when you get to the restaurant just point to what other people are eating and tell them you want that."

"August 30, 2019",50,I absolutely love this place,It‚Äôs not the first time we are coming but the last time was Thursday 29th for diner it was a family one but we came with some friends as well!  The meat is just perfect and so are the side dishes the starters but we are not huge fan of the scrambled eggs!  This Time We tools the K.O.B platter some extra croquettes and the chorizo ( by the way this one is big quite nice to share as well) After some meats as well( I cannot give any recommendations they are all so good !!!! Just pick anyone you will not be disappointed ). We love your fries and the spinach but all the sides we ordered were very good.  The place itself is lovely and the staff is friendly efficient and all of them made us having a great moment!  Thank you very much and we will come back soon !
"August 30, 2019",30,Good food but over priced....,"Recommended only for adults. Nice ambiance in the restaurant, food was good but nothing really memorable; would say over priced for what they offer."
"August 28, 2019",50,Delicious steaks!,"We recently dined here with our two small children, the food and service were excellent! We had 3 different cuts of steak, all were amazing! Wine recommendation was great as well."
"August 10, 2019",50,Fantastic steak and wonderful service,"Three of us had a wonderful dinner in late February 2019. The service from the very beginning was warm and cordial, despite the lateness (9:30) of our reservation. We stayed until 11:30 or so and never felt rushed. I liked the rich, dark colors that reminded me of a men's club. The other diners were dressed well and people spoke in quiet tones that were conducive to dining. Since steak is the featured food item, it's little surprise that such great attention is given to its preparation. All of us thoroughly enjoyed our steak as well as the delicious vegetables that garnished the meat. I tend to privilege service over food, but here, the food was absolutely top notch. This restaurant is a keeper!"
"July 3, 2019",50,Lip-smacking delicious!,"My wife and I dined at K.O.B. (short for Knowledge of Beef, though there are a few other main dishes on the menu) on Monday night and loved it! Our Portuguese sirloin and ribeye dishes were slightly but superbly seasoned so that the sauces we ordered to accompany them were superfluous. (There are cuts of meat from many countries, but the Portuguese cuts are the least expensive.) They were both perfectly cooked at medium rare. Really, lip-smacking delicious.  Also, an excellent side dish of rice/red beans/bits of (I believe) chorizo...slightly spicy and so flavorful that as a larger portion it really could constitute a wonderful main dish. A nice salad and grilled asparagus side as well.  Ironically, we ended up at K.O.B. because we were looking for a nice place near our hotel and that was open late (I believe until midnight) on a Monday night. We weren't especially looking for steaks, so I almost ordered the grilled octopus instead. Lucky for us that K.O.B is open on Mondays and lucky for me that I went with the meat.  It's a smallish restaurant (maybe 40 seats?) with a pleasant, dimly lit ambiance and good service. Menu has English translations for all items. The staff also explains any terms that still aren't clear.  We requested a quiet, private table for a romantic meal, and the staff thoughtfully reserved a corner table for us. That being said, there's a bit of a buzz to the conversations in the place, so I wouldn't quite call it quiet or intimate in that respect. But the noise is by no means overwhelming - just normal restaurant chatter; we certainly had no problem conversing and fully enjoyed our romantic evening.  I vaguely recall (if I'm recalling the right restaurant) that a few TA reviews might have mentioned smoking in the small bar area you pass through to get to the dining room. We didn't notice any while passing through or while dining (in a corner table on the other side of a wall from the bar), and the two sections are kind of separated from each other anyway. But if that's a real concern, simply ask for a table away from the bar area.  Anyway, again, a great meal that we highly recommend!"
"June 17, 2019",50,Best steak in a long time,"KOB was recommended by a friend who lives in Lisbon, as well as the hotel staff during my stay. Not a massive restaurant but dark moody lighting with friendly staff make you feel quickly at home. Every table was taken on a busy Saturday night, so best to reserve well in advance.  Tenderloin Portuguese steak was one of the best I've eaten anywhere in the world."
"June 9, 2019",50,WOW,"I will keep short and simple. Best steaks in town, great choice of wine, amazing menu... I dont know how to explain it. It was one wonderful experience for me and my GF to be there and be served and eat. Thanks for that !"

The wine list lived up to expectations, and they had several great bottles from the different regions of Portugal. We had a great time and a great meal, it was a perfect way to start our trip. On our last night back in Lisbon, we were trying to figure out where to go for dinner. We both kept talking about how much we loved the steak on our first night, so we decided to just go back.

After greeting us by name at the door when we came in, he did a great job taking care of us and explaining the menu. The ham starter was wonderful and the ham just melted in your mouth. We had the two variations of the filet and both were cooked perfectly, even for Americans who like our ""medium"" to be pink rather than red. We could not have asked for a better experience and they certainly lived up to the expectations set by Wine Spectator"
"October 14, 2015",30,Nothing but steaks,"Considered by most one of the best steaks in Lisbon I was surprised to find that they taste no different than many other cheaper and less fancier places. Two types of cut and one sauce made of butter and cream do not make a fantastic meal. At least not for me at such scandalous prices. The place looks like an old bar from the fifties which can be a change from newer places, but it really looks dark and old fashion. If you really like basic steaks go, otherwise send your money in more interesting food."

Right in front of the parliament, you ring the bell to get in and a very friendly waiter answers the door for you. Inside, the all red and gold decor do remind you of an old English pub. According to some Portuguese friends this was considered the best steak restaurant in Lisbon and we can say that in fact it was the best we had while staying there. The menu is short. A couple of starters then 3 steaks to choose from and two types of meat, filet mignon or sirloin. Then the sauces, Portuguese style or a cream and pepper marrare style both mouth watering. An extensive wines list with a full range of Portuguese wines from Douro to Alentejo region. Our waitress was very friendly, well informed about the wines and gave us lots of tips about places to go out of the busy tourist frenzy. Certainly we will return on our next trip because overall it was a very good experience :)"

"January 6, 2016",40,"If you want to have good meat,","This is where you should go. We enjoyed really good meat, delicious ceviche and friendly service. The restaurant is not at all traditional, so if you want to have authentic Portuguese food, you'd better find some other restaurant. Modern restaurant in the phase of expansion."
"November 9, 2015",40,"Excellent concept, food and service","We celebrated my sister's birthday at O Talho and it was excellent. We all tried different dishes and each one was delicious. I particularly recommend the dish ""O Sr quer Alheira"". The desserts were also very good. A nice experience!"

"November 10, 2013",40,"unusual for Portugal, but good, meat specialist","No, they don't do fish, dishes don't all come with rice, and there's no soup. This place specializes in meat, and a modern style. I came with a work group, and we had just two choices for starter (scrambled eggs with sausage, or ham hock salad), and two for main (sausage, or hamburger). Put that like, it sounds awful, but it was actually very good. The eggs with chopped-up sausage were excellent, and the hamburger did _not_ look like anything from McDonald - it was just a well-prepared ball of good quality mince (no silly bread bap), with some chips and salad. The sausage also looked good - a large, chicken-based creature. Followed by a good double-chocolate mousse, I came away very satisfied.  There was a fair use of pretentious plates (the main sausage came on a slate) and so on on, but in a cheerful spirit, with a friendly waiter."
