"August 12, 2018",50,Taste of local cuisine,"During our first visit of Rome we wanted to try local cuisine beyond spaghetti and lasagna and our walk through Trastevere we found the perfect place for it. On first sight we saw la bunch of locals eating there and once we got there experienced the kindness of the staff. They translated the menu more than once for us - whereas I would like to mention that it consisted of a few main courses, which was a plus for us. The prices were reasonable, a starter was 5‚Ç¨, while a main course 10-16‚Ç¨. We also drank some Aperol Spritz which was 6‚Ç¨ each. If you are in Rome, definitely try this gem!"
"August 9, 2018",50,The perfect last supper in Rome,"My best friend and I found this restaurant by accident. It was our last day in Rome and we wanted to celebrate a fine vacation with a matching fine meal so we headed out to Trastavere at lunchtime to randomly find a place. It was the many locals sitting around, chatting and having lunch that drew us in. We made the right decision picking this restaurant: the staff was very charming, very Italian and very helpful (and they spoke fluent English). They didn't mind translating the entire menu for us (twice) and they convinced me to try a meal that I probably wouldn't have chosen otherwise (octopus sandwich) which turned out to be delightful. The menu is not too long and offers mostly fish/seafood-based traditional, but not commonly known meals (at least for tourists), so we especially enjoyed that we ate traditional, delicious Italian food that was still special and new. All in all, come here for the warm, funny and professional service, the friendly, local atmosphere and if you want to try food that's not that mainstream yet easy to appreciate for anyone. The prices won't break the bank either (entr√© 5 eur, main dishes from 10-15). Grazie for a perfect last meal! :)"

"July 21, 2018",50,Amazing new restaurant in Trastevere!,"My husband and I visited Peppo based on a recommendation from our Airbnb host. It was one of the best meals we've ever eaten. There are also staff who speak English, though this restaurant is not in a touristy area, and the menu is not in English. We ordered our waiter's favorite of the pizzas, and his favorite of the pastas. Of course all is fresh and hand made there in the restaurant. Prices are very fair and reasonable, and food is amazing. Out of this world, truly! All should give this new and delicious restaurant a chance!"
