"February 8, 2020",20,Subpar...,"Simple and Slique REVISION – @del.friscos review  This steakhouse was suggested and because I had never been, I was excited to go. Our server Josh (the 2nd server named Josh in two days) was very nice, attentive and explained the menu and the specials to us in detail. The bread and drinks came quickly, the bread, I give a 4 out of 10. In a steakhouse I was expecting superior bread, but instead received a large sesame seeded roll, that had no real texture or taste. The drink (a blood orange Manhattan), was very tasty. We asked our server some basic questions about some menu items and I was surprised at some of the answers. When asked if we could have a few items (crab cakes, and crab fried rice) prepared without butter we were told it would not be possible, that is how the meal comes. I was confused and did not understand the reasoning. We are in a restaurant where I assume chefs are preparing my meal, why is it butter could not be replaced with EVOO? So of course, I immediately “assumed” (and I could be wrong), some menu items are prepackaged/pre-made, and reheated for the customer. I could not come to any other conclusion as to why something as simple as “butter” could not be replaced with EVOO. When our meal came out, it was so disjointed. Some items were right, but others were wrong, so when we mentioned it, the manager came over and grabbed the incorrect items, leaving us with the “correct” items (instead of taking it all away and bringing us a HOT correct meal all at once) which means a portion of our meal would be hot and the other portion cool at best. The food was subpar, period! The location is in the big business district of Manhattan, so I can see people bringing clients here for lunch and young adults coming here with someone they are seemingly interested in, all in an attempt to impress with the high priced/overpriced menu choices. The manager did come over and rectify this situation nicely, as well as apologized profusely for our dining experience. I give this place a 5 out of 10. #simpleand_slique"
"February 6, 2020",50,"If you like your steak, then","If you like your steak, then make sure you check this place out... I have tried a good few steak restaurants an some very high recommended like gauchos, hawk Moore’s And stk... I would quite easily say the fillet here is out of this world and full of flavour I really could not explain how nice it was. If you have ever heard of the expression ‘FOOD PORN’ then this is the closest I think I have come to it .... the lamb chops are also very tasty but would recommend the steak."
"January 25, 2020",50,Fantastic,"We had dinner with friends. We had a great waiter, David. We saw their amazing wine cellar. My fillet was Fantastic. I will definitely return on my next trip to New York City."

"January 19, 2020",30,Amazing steak but why such a rude server...,"One of the better steaks that I have had, but the experience ruined by the most condescending server I have encountered.
