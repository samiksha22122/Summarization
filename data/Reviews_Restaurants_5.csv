"February 17, 2019",50,Amazing Steakhouse,This place was amazing from start to finish. I will say that you should make reservations and it is pricey. If you are ok with that then you will love the steak here. The prime rib is amaaaazing. Loved it.

"February 3, 2019",30,Good but not great,"Porterhouse for 2 was good but not great. Based on the price and reputation it should have been great. I've eaten at top 10's all over the country, and Bobby Van's porter for 2 was a much better steak."

"January 19, 2019",50,Wonderful,"Ordered the T-bone it was amazing, mushroom sauce was divine such a big steak couldn’t even have room for desert but still ordered it and cheesecake was great, Will go back."
"January 18, 2019",50,My sweet memory Chateau Keens,I tried Chateau Keens which is from California. I have never met such perfect balanced red before. Good combination with sirloin steak. 勿体ぶらずにこちらのお店ではお金をかけて美味しいものを頂くこと、そしてぜひ赤ワインを試すことをお勧めします。食べると必ず価値が分かるはずです。
"January 11, 2019",50,True N.Y. Steakhouse,Great steak. Cooked perfectly. Loved the little surprise appetizers before our meal. Loved our Manhattans as well. Loved the history of this steakhouse from the 1890s. Will return when we return to NYC.
"January 11, 2019",30,Meh,Steak just ok. No complaints but not in my top 10 for NYC. Great service and ambience but nothing else above average to call out.
"January 6, 2019",50,Everything gorgeous,"Looking for a steakhouse downtown NY, we went to the closest one to our hotel. It turned to be a perfect choice. Location is warm and service is excellent. We had a fantastic T-bone with French fries, absolutely delicious. Strongly recommended"
"January 2, 2019",50,Exceptional,We went here for New Years Eve. We had the Porterhouse for two and it was the best steak I've ever had and possibly the best restaurant meal I've ever had. Service was superb as well. Just a faultless experience.
"January 10, 2019",40,Great food and bad service,"I took my family to celebrate my husband’s Birthday. We were seated in the private room on the second floor. We ordered the drinks and there were brought 15 minutes later. The bus boy brought us the bread with the butter. However, the waiter did...More"
"January 8, 2019",50,I'll be back - again and again,"At the recommendation of Mike Colemeco we tried this ancient steakhouse. It was great. Its very historic and charming. The vibe is very family down-home intimate non-stuffy but confident in quality. It's tight quarters and not without some steps to navigate. The football sized prime rib is the prize. The cheesecake is also top notch. Wine selection was modest; but, adequate. Good value."
"January 7, 2019",50,"Steak was nice, rest above avergae","Went on a recent visit to NY, unfortunately could not get a booking at Peter Lugers at short notice and as they was near the hotel decided to go there. Pleasant atmosphere and service so we opted for this as the reviews were good. No complaints regarding the food or service, however was not impressed for an average $100 per person"
"January 7, 2019",20,Disappointed,"This was the first reservation I made for our trip to NYC and one that I was looking most forward to - unfortunately the food and experience were very underwhelming. We were seated on the second floor and perhaps not being in the main dining room took away from the ambience. The upstairs room was drafty and quite bright. The food was meh and the service was lacking. The New York Times website has a great cast iron method for cooking steak that yields more flavour than the NY sirloin or filet mignon that we ordered. The creamed spinach also fell flat and desperately needed salt. The mushrooms were excellent and the one redeeming item we tried. Not sure if ordering a bottle of wine would have garnered better service but our waitress did not seem impressed with ordering by the glass. Before leaving, I used the ladies washroom in the bar area and it was in a filthy state. Definitely glad I hadn't seen that pre-meal. Would not recommend or return."
"January 6, 2019",50,New Years Eve to remember,Wow! What an amazing night. I’m so glad I booked Keens in October / November for New Year Eves (even if it wasn’t pouring down outside all night!!)! Not only was the food incredible - steak and mutton - but the service and the atmosphere was spot on. We walked by that morning to make sure we knew where we were going for later on. Although they were closed they welcomed us in as I was intrigued. The complimentary glass of champagne for midnight was perfect and I will remember this NY in NYC forever. Worth every penny!  BOOK HERE NOT TIME SQUARE!!  Thank you Keens.
"January 6, 2019",50,Everything gorgeous,"Looking for a steakhouse downtown NY, we went to the closest one to our hotel. It turned to be a perfect choice. Location is warm and service is excellent. We had a fantastic T-bone with French fries, absolutely delicious. Strongly recommended"
"January 5, 2019",20,Overcrowded and dirty.,"I was really looking forward to coming here. I had waited all week for the reservation and had high hopes. I guess I had imagined a nice white linen table cloth restaurant with good food and good service... What put me off the most was the entrance lobby. I opened the door and could hardly get in because of the amount of people loitering in the entrance lobby. I couldn't see where the hostess was and it felt stuffy and overcrowded. When I did find the hostess, we were sent to the bar area to wait for the table. Again, very overcrowded, full of tourists, not locals like I would have expected, you could not get a seat anywhere in the bar. It was also very off putting that a few people were eating their food at bar area. When we eventually fended are way to the table through the crowds of tourists, I just felt the whole place was dusty and dirty and not what I had imagined. I know it has history and is old but that doesn't excuse it being unclean. The pictures on the wall next to my table were so dusty, no one clearly hasn't wiped them down for a very long time. The food was ok but I just couldn't enjoy it because I felt so uneasy. We left , but getting my coat was another drama, again because there were so many people blocking the lobby entrance. If I were the manager, I would look at this straight away. Its like a Mcdonalds when you walk in. Just madness. I would not return to this restaurant. A tourist trap and a dirty one at that."
"January 4, 2019",50,"Amazing Steaks, Fascinating Historical Restaurant","Keens opened in 1885 and the atmosphere will be a big hit with history fans. They have an extremely large collection of pipes (long ago, they used to keep them there for patrons) including those smoked by Babe Ruth, Teddy Roosevelt, and other celebs. The steaks are absolutely outstanding. Service is very friendly and prompt. And the atmosphere is appropriate for anyone, regardless of attire or company (even kids). Highly recommend Keens!"
"January 2, 2019",50,Exceptional,We went here for New Years Eve. We had the Porterhouse for two and it was the best steak I've ever had and possibly the best restaurant meal I've ever had. Service was superb as well. Just a faultless experience.
"December 30, 2018",50,Excellent food and service,We went there for late lunch. We had steak and salad and wine and dessert. The Pinot Noir was A rated. We know good steak and this was no exception. There is a reason why this restaurant has been on business for so long. We recommend this place as a first class food and service place.

"April 28, 2018",50,Truly legendary,"Many places claim to be legendary, but this one really is. To go straight to the point: I had both the mutton and the king's cut. Both are very generous and savory, but first-time visitors should really go for the mutton, because it is delicious,...More"
"April 26, 2018",40,Amazing Steak at a Price,"I knew before booking our reservation that this restaurant would be expensive. It was well worth it for one great evening. Everything was exceptional except the bill, which will run you $100+ a person; so be prepared to spend some coin! Regardless of the price, again Keens is more than worth it! There was not one thing cooked incorrectly, i.e. - crab cakes, steaks, puffy blue cheese, carrot cake, etc.."
"April 26, 2018",50,Amazing!,"Everything perfect from the service to the meal! We really enjoyed the relaxed pace, never rushed. Relaxing meal!"
"April 24, 2018",50,Eat steak like an old time gentleman,"Celebrated a friend's 40th birthday here and we all ate great steak like old timey fancy people in this historic steakhouse. I ordered the King's cut prime rib because I overestimated my abilities. It was incredible but I could not finish it. The juiciest steak of my life. The fat tasted better than a lot of other steaks. No one in the group had the mutton although that is their premier dish. I regret that. We all overate, drank bourbon, and felt like fat cats dining with Teddy Rossevelt."
"April 23, 2018",50,Best Steak in NY,"I've eaten at Peter Luger's in Brooklyn, Ruth's Chris, Morgan's, Del Frisco's, Old Homestead and of course Keen's. In my opinion the top two are Keen's and Luger's. But since Luger's is in Brooklyn, Keen's is the best steak in Manhattan by quite a big margin. All of them (not sure about Luger's - its been awhile) pour melted butter over the steak. Keen's does not. In my opinion, that's cheating. EVERYTHING tastes better with butter. But Keen's does not. The taste is out of this world. Their ages steaks are properly marbled and cooked to perfection so you don't need the butter. My son requests Keen's for his birthday dinner every year. And we are happy to oblige. I also know that I can always accompany my steak with my favorite Lagavulin scotch and a nice big red wine. I like to finish it off with a nice port. Meals at Keen's are exquisite. And the pipes lining the ceiling are cool, especially when you have someone who works there tell you the story behind the pipes. I have no connection to the restaurant except as a customer who has been going here for at least 15 years. Best in Manhattan."
"April 23, 2018",50,One of NY's Finest,"This is a steak and chophouse. Big, hearty portions and large perfectly cook steaks.  It's a busy restaurant at dinner time. It's a bit quieter for lunch. But, this is not a quiet romantic environment. It's fun! The pipes on the ceiling are cool and there is a strong sense of history and culture throughout the restaurant.  Service is good, like I said, its a busy place. And, yes, if you're pinching pennies this is not the place for you."
"April 23, 2018",40,Very Good Steak : P,Expensive steak... but it’s very good ^ ^  Portion is quite big for an Asian like me! Suggest to order 2 steak to share with 3 people or else it’s either a waste or take away > <  Simple comment: it tastes GOOD and JUICY... it was the 2nd time I dinner there with the same colleagues which we all felt the steaks was good and yummy!
"April 22, 2018",40,Hoped for better,The steak was tasty but not up to my high standards of the last few steaks I’ve had. Friendly staff and interesting atmosphere.
"April 21, 2018",20,Freezing cold and draughty.,Six of us visited Keens to celebrate our friends 50th Birthday. We had all been there 5 years ago to celebrate mine and it was top of our too do list to repeat the experience. Some of us have been in between these visits and we're never disappointed. We booked the table 6 months in advance stating that it was a birthday celebration. The food as always was outstanding. Terrific steaks and the legendary mutton chop did not disappoint. However our table was just inside the entrance and we were freezing. We kept getting up to close over the curtain to stop the draught and try and keep the heat in. We asked the reception staff to keep the curtain closed however they left it open every time they came through it. We advised our server that we were cold but nothing was done about it. We also advised him that our steaks got cold very quickly and the sides were cold almost immediately. We did not wait for dessert as we were all freezing cold. It was only after we asked for the bill and complained again that the air con began to put out slightly warm air. It smelt very stale and dusty as if it hadn't been on recently. We were all very disappointed and annoyed that our friends birthday celebration was spoiled. We hope our next visit will be a much better experience.
"April 21, 2018",40,Superior old school steakhouse,Went here before our show on Broadway with some skepticism. It was excellent. Very cool authentic vibe and really great steaks.

"April 18, 2018",50,Stalwart steakhouse in Nyc,Steeped in history the Mutton Chop is a ‘must’ and the Prime Rib a close second. The Bloody Mary is so good you feel as though you could ask for a knife and fork !

"March 11, 2018",50,"Super food, service and setting",Wonderful steak cooked to perfection in a fascinating setting full of history. Ceiling lined with old clay pipes and the menu shares the story behind them. As usual portions are huge so share any sides between 2 or 3.
"March 9, 2018",50,Second time didn't disappoint,I went there for lunch this time and still great!! The thick cut bacon was excellent. The salad with sirloin was tasty. They were very accommodating when I made modifications.

"February 19, 2017",50,"Very good steakhouse, not #1","I've visited all the top steakhouses for work and I can say this is really one of the best, but not the best. There's nothing to complain about here but wolfgangs is the cream of the crop"
"February 15, 2017",50,Still one of my favorite restaurants in NYC,I'm never disappointed when I eat here. I like to sit in the Pub Room. We usually go before or after a Ranger game have the Filet and Chicken Under a Brick. Food and service are always great.
"February 15, 2017",30,Disappointing,"For these prices, the steak should not be average! My son ordered the special Porterhouse, and it was just OK we are not likely to return. That said, the service was wonderful, and the pipe collection on the ceiling was very impressive."
"February 14, 2017",50,Pub Room always great,Arrive by 5 and you will score a table in the small Pub room. Excellent cheeseburger and crabmeat salad. Ate there twice last week. Never disappoints!

"February 12, 2017",50,Historic charm and great food,"The room is a delight, full of historic prints, with a collection of churchwarden pipes on the ceiling. I had the ""Legendary Mutton Chop"", a massive mutton chop. Delicious. Great service."
"February 11, 2017",50,"2nd trip, just as good!","2nd time visited, just as good as the first. Largest steak I've ever seen! Ordered it as a medium but was more like medium rare but wasn't a problem, but might be worth bearing in mind."

"February 2, 2017",50,Excellent food - Huge portions,The meal was superb! I ordered the shrimp cocktail and T-Bone steak and both were delicious. For desert we had the creme brulee - also perfect! I highly recommend going to Keen's if you want a good steak.
"January 31, 2017",50,Best steak that I have ever had,Best steak that I have ever had - Go here. You must!!! a bit pricey but then everything in USA is too expensive unfortunately
"February 7, 2017",50,Gorgeous steakhouse.,"Excellent hospitality here. Lovely ambience. Friendly, helpful staff and quite frankly the best fillet steak I have ever had!! Highly recommended Keens Steakhouse. In fact I would like to squeeze in another quick visit before I leave !"
"February 5, 2017",50,"Delicious steak, lovely cocktails","Came here for a birthday dinner whilst visiting NYC and it did not disappoint. We shared the porter house for 2 with veg and mash sides with a peppercorn sauce, all delicious. We also tried some cocktails cosmo and mai tai- both really well made....More"
"February 5, 2017",20,Overpriced and Overrated,"What a difference 7 years make! I loved Keens in the old days but its not what it used to be (excepting the service remains excellent). Our supposedly ""Prime"" beef and mutton was questionable as evidenced by a decided lack of flavor and depth. Sides are so-so at best. If you are a tourist insist on dining in the main ground floor dining room or one of the side rooms. Sitting in the upstairs main dining room is like being stuck in steerage; I couldn't hear my family talk due to the gym-like cacophony surrounding us. Overpriced and overrated. If its steak you want you are better off at Pete Luger's in Brooklyn."
"February 3, 2017",50,Iconic Steakhouse,No wonder Keens is often listed in top lists as one of the best/iconic steakhouses in the United States. What a treat to mosey out of Times Square and on down a bit into this old world restaurant with little tables and dated décor that is not at all passé. We are working our way through one of the aforementioned lists and this was our favorite so far.
"February 2, 2017",50,Excellent food - Huge portions,The meal was superb! I ordered the shrimp cocktail and T-Bone steak and both were delicious. For desert we had the creme brulee - also perfect! I highly recommend going to Keen's if you want a good steak.
"February 2, 2017",50,Steak with Lincoln & Friends,"Not only was the food great, but it was a throwback in time with pipes on the ceiling from the 45,000 members going back to President Lincoln. After lunch we had a private tour of the well preserved rooms, which was like an archived museum. Fascinating dining spot and highly recommended for taking out special clients!"
"January 31, 2017",40,Steak night,We came to keens as a present bought by friends who had eaten here previously with glowing reviews.  We had cocktails before being seating which were very tasty! (The Bloody Mary is defiantly one to try) We had a lobster starter also which was very nice indeed.  The main course however I am unsure if I ordered wrong but it was a little over facing. A 38 oz cut of rib eye which I eat about a quarter of. My friends recommended the steak to share for two which did look very nice also. My over half had a fillet which was cooked perfectly and tasted the same. When we visit NY again I would love to come back and try a different cut as I am sure I ordered incorrectly.  The wine list is out of this world - I've never seen one like it.
"January 31, 2017",50,Best steak that I have ever had,Best steak that I have ever had - Go here. You must!!! a bit pricey but then everything in USA is too expensive unfortunately
"January 30, 2017",50,Amazing,"Went to Keens whilst visiting New York and had the best steak and lump crab cocktail ever! The service was attentive and the ambience had a great buzz, glad I don't live here as I would be tempted to visit often and would inevitably pile in the pounds"
"January 30, 2017",50,Sublime - best steak I've ever had!,"My partner and I ate here on a Sunday evening. The atmosphere was fabulous, created mostly by the eclectic interior and attentive service (look up at the ceiling and revel in the myriad of pipes!!) The food was incredible. My partner had the surf and turf (mignon + lobster) and I had the mignon. Luckily for him, even though I went for the smaller size, I could not eat it all and so he happily lapped up my leftovers. My partner is not prone to over-enthusing about food but as he tucked into his plate he uttered the words ""I don't want to stop eating this"" which was more praise than I've ever heard from him before! One word of warning, we attempted to order a portion of chips each, the waiter corrected us that one would be plenty and boy was he right!! We both had dessert, he the Key Lime Pie and I the Affogato. We also had a lower-end price bottle of wine but it was outstandingly good. The whole meal came to around £100 per head and was worth every single penny"
"January 29, 2017",50,Great visit,Keens is my fauvorit steakhouse in New York. Incredible good service every time. And the food is alway first class.
"January 25, 2017",40,Great but expensive,I had a great meal at Keens for lunch but even at lunch the sticker shock was in full effect. Seems like it would be a great special occasion place. Definitely get dessert!!!
"January 25, 2017",50,Great dinner - good place to talk,Had an early dinner with my wife. We both able to hear each other - no background music! Food was excellent. My lamb chops were perfectly done and my wife chicken was delicious with rosemary leaves and very juicy flavored with white wine.
"January 25, 2017",40,Great Porterhouse,"Had an excellent double Porterhouse for 6 persons at the second floor of Keens. Not exactly the same fantastic atmosphere than downstairs, but quieter environment. Cooking was just perfect and the Porterhouses disappeared almost as fast as they came to the table."
"January 22, 2017",40,"Nice atmosphere, check out the ceramic pipe collection","We went there for late dinner after a Rangers game and was seated promptly in the bar area. My wife had a Cobb Salad which was delicious and I had Turkey Schnitzel which was good, not great. A lively place with attentive service."
"January 18, 2017",50,Excellent food!,"We enjoyed dinner at Keens Steakhouse and it was very deliscious! Good meat but also good other choices. It has something for everyone. A special hint: try the ""Mai Tai"" drink. Amazing!"
"January 13, 2017",50,Quality that doesn't grow old,Came back to Keens after a few years of not going there and the food was just as good as I remember. Great meat. Good wine list and unique atmosphere - you can't go wrong

"November 30, 2016",30,Ambience better than the food,"Selected this restaurant based on reviews and its history. Although food and service was good, I expected better. Limited selection of steaks. My steak was slightly overcooked and the seafood salad would have been better with less dressing."
"November 28, 2016",50,Epic!!!,"Best (and biggest) steak I have ever had by far, a must visit for any meat eater. Friendly staff and interesting decoration"
"November 27, 2016",50,WOW!,"Wonderful filet, creamed spinach (which I don't normally care for) and desserts. Gracious staff. Recommend reservations."

"November 21, 2016",30,Very expensive,"I can not deny the quality of the meat, but I think it is very expensive. The atmosphere very noisy and the tables very close together, which does not allow you to chat. i would not go back"
"November 20, 2016",50,Best Steak ever!!,Great location and beautifully furnished. On our New York Trips it is a must for dinner! We recommend the porterhouse for two but also the filet mignon is worth! It is always worth a visit!
"November 15, 2016",50,Great mutton,"A great. classic, old school steakhouse. The mutton chop is worth the $$. Shrimp cocktail was ordinary. The wedge salad was excellent. Service was professional and consciousness. Warm rolls were perfect."

"November 4, 2016",50,"Mutton mutton, who's got the mutton?","Go for the muttonchops. And since you're already there, add some carbs (creamy mashed potatoes) and fatty vegetables (creamed spinach). And top it all off with some mushrooms to boot. Worth the hype. Beautiful old-school ambiance. Always a pleasure."
"November 1, 2016",30,Date night,Nothing to write home about. Staff was not very helpful and super slow. Restaurant was very stuffy. Uncomfortably warm with outside temps in the mid 40s. Steak was good but not very flavorful. $245 meal for two I expected to be blown away.
"October 30, 2016",50,Excellent classic steak dinner,Great service - very efficient but not rushed. Enjoyed the artichoke then shared the porterhouse for 2 (among 3) which was delicious and well seasoned. Not a cheap meal but worth every cent.

"October 28, 2016",50,I will never eat a better steak,"First off this place isn't cheap, but I can't fault a single thing about it. The meat was cooked to perfection and so tasty. The service was attentive and they were helpful in choosing what to eat."
"October 22, 2016",30,Too loud,"An OK meal, but not for the price. Lobster Bisque was good, but had pieces of crab meat in it, not lobster. $20 for the roasted vegetables."
"October 20, 2016",50,Great steak and service,"Great steak, great wine suggestion, great service and interesting place with lot of history. More expensive than mid-range, but not too pricy and absolute worth it."

"October 14, 2016",50,What a fabulous dinner,"The place is very historic. The food was outstanding and the service matched. The steaks, mutton chop and prime rib all made for a meal to remember. Save room for desert, which was equally impressive."
"October 13, 2016",30,Had a way better steak in TX for half the price,"The atmosphere is very unique and cool, along with a very friendly waitstaff. However, my steak was not up to pair with any steak place in TX. Was not worth the price at all."
"October 11, 2016",50,Top steak house,"Great atmosphere and decor, with the thousands of pipes. Very good food and excellent service. It's not for no reason that Keens has been around for a very long time."

"September 24, 2016",40,Seriously good steak,Top notch steakhouse. Excellent cuts of beef prepared just as ordered. We were massively overdressed. Weird since dinner for two can easily exceed $300. Service was good but not great. No complaints about the food. Desserts need an upgrade. Coffee we excellent.
"September 20, 2016",40,The biggest steak you will ever see or eat in your life,"In summary, Keens is a must for anyone willing to fork out for the steak of their life, in a historic, quaint chop house which has an old-worldly feel to it."

Thank you Keene's for being my favourite restaurant in NYC and also my childrens. And soon I expect my grand childrens also :-)
"September 14, 2016",50,Noisy,"Great for a group of friends but not for a quiet meal. Steak did not bowl us over, had better food elsewhere. Had to send our steak back, it was not medium."
"September 14, 2016",20,High price for average food.,My wife and I were jammed into a table between two tables with 4 people on each side. Only exit was between our table and theirs. Spent 176.00 and while the portion was large the flavor was below average.
"September 13, 2016",50,Awesome food and atmosphere.,"One of the best steak dinners we've had anywhere. A tremendous restaurant experience all around, from the smoking pipe decor to every bit of food and drink we tried. Be advised - it's not cheap. But no great steak meal ever is."

"August 13, 2016",50,One of The Best,"This is yet another institution in The City. For some reason I prefer the chops here, but not because the steaks aren't just as scrumptious. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose at this place."
"August 9, 2016",50,"One of the top steak houses in NYC - great food, wine list and charming setting",It doesn't get much better than Keens. Porterhouse is fantastic. Mutton chops are very unique. Thick cut bacon is incredible. This is an old school steakhouse at its best.

"July 15, 2016",30,Nice steak,Very nice steak with a good Caesar salad. Good atmosphere with good music but a little expensive for this type of food: steak and salad. There are other options that I did not prove and seems to be very good.
"July 9, 2016",50,Super Steakhouse,"The porterhouse for 2 was huge, we also ordered lobster which was also huge. All perfectly cooked and quality meat and fish. Service was excellent - professional and helpful. Hard to get into but worth it if you get a slot."
"July 6, 2016",40,One of the best in New York,"Have been going to Keens for years every time I go to NYC. Consistently excellent steaks. If you are two people, go for the porterhouse for two, you can't go wrong."
"July 1, 2016",50,Mutton Mutton Mutton,I've eaten at all the great NY Steakhouses many times. However none have anything quite like a Keens Mutton Chop. Worth it a few times a year to satifiy that lamb craving.
"June 28, 2016",50,One of my favorite Steak House's in the City,"One the best steaks in the city. Love sitting at the bar or in the upstair dinning rooms. Their fresh ginger ale is the best... sometime it's not on the menu, so ask."

"May 12, 2016",30,too young to rock too old to die,"too narrow between tables, low ceilings which, incidentally, would need a good cleaning. Meat is ok, otherwise it can be expected much more of a restaurant in this price range"
"May 10, 2016",50,Great Food,Food and service was excellent. Sat in the pub side which is first come first serve if you don't have a reservation. Highly recommend the 12 oz prime filet.

"May 3, 2016",40,One of the best in NYC,"Classic NYC steakhouse, with great history, and atmosphere. This is where to go to get that old school NYC feel, while also getting a fantastic steak and meal. Most of the newer NY restaurants don't have the charm and character of this place."

"April 22, 2016",30,Mutton chops are nothing to write home about,We specifically went to Keen's because of their mutton chops. Four of us were not impressed.

"April 22, 2016",50,Really fantastic steakhouse.,They are famous for their Mutton Chop. Fantastic. I devoured the whole thing. It was just amazing. Dont forget the delicious chocolate cake.
"April 21, 2016",50,Best Steakhouse in New York,Keens is the best steakhouse in New York. Anyone who tells you otherwise is mis-informed or doesn't appreciate New York style steakhouses.

"March 7, 2016",50,Great steak and amazing experience!,"Its a most for steak lover. I had the T-bone steak and it was very good! the porterhouse is also very delicious. Some could consider it expensive, but the food quality, the service and everything worth it! I recommend :)"

"February 18, 2016",30,Nothing exceptional,"A place very valued, but without reasons. The meat is good, but nothing exceptional, except the high price. If you want to eat good meat, try a Brazilian or Argentine steakhouse, the cost benefit will be much better."

Enjoyed the best of New York Steakhouse experience, But, the price $$$$."

"October 9, 2015",50,Old world charm with great food,"Was taken here by a colleague. Old world charm epitomised by wood panelled rooms and an amazing collection of clay pipes everywhere. Friendly and informative staff guided us to a shared porterhouse and mutton for which Keen's is rightly famous. Don't be put off - this isn't mutton as you might imagine it but rather tasty slices of pink, tender and flavoursome meat. The porterhouse was well hung and equally tasty and enjoyable. Atmosphere was great - not too business orientated and anyone would feel comfortable eating there. Will be back as soon as possible .  tenderpink cooked"
"October 9, 2015",50,Excellent food + service,"This restaurant was fantastic. My husband +i went for an anniversary lunch here and as soon as we opened the door the maitre'd made us feel very welcome... We dined in the lincoln room, with its wood panelling and lovely tables overlooking the street. My husband had the dry aged T-bone steak and i had the filet mignon with sauce au poivre, they both just melted on the tongue... We followed our servers advice + just had one serving of baby new potatoes between us as the serving was quite large + the panroasted cauliflower/broccoli and sauteed mushrooms were just right. It was a shame that we had no room for dessert as they looked good. The service was also excellent and deserved their tips as they were very attentive. I loved looking at the names on the smoking pipes on the way out, that was fun but glad they are not in use now..."

"October 8, 2015",30,Good but not great,"I went to keens this weekend during a conference for work. Went with group of 8 colleagues. Food was good, just not great. Waiter spilled wine, and forgot drink. Wasn't bad at all, just didn't blow my mind. Will try new steak restaurant next time I go."
"October 6, 2015",50,"Great meal, atmosphere and service","No doubt well worth a visit, a highlight in our NY trip. We had the Porterhouse with vegetables and a glass of Cabernet. The service was perfect and we made it in time to our Broadway show. Will definitely go back."

I was a bit apprehensive because I thought it would be all hype, but it was wonderful - clubby atmosphere, chock full of history, the food was exceptional and service attentive yet not overbearing. Expensive, but I'm worth it ha ha!"
"August 6, 2015",40,Neat Historic NY Steakhouse!,"I've dined at Keens a couple of dozen times over the years. It's a neat historic New York steakhouse, with quality traditional steakhouse fare, a nice wine list and very good service. I've truly never had a bad meal here and always enjoy coming back. Try the porterhouse for two. Cheers!"
"August 6, 2015",50,Great 'historical' steak house,"I had a short visit to NY planned and one of the things my kids (15 & 12 years old) wanted to do was have a great steak in Manhattan.  The service was very good and the restaurant had a great 'buzz' around it. We ate upstairs and walked up a creaky staircase which gave us the impression that we were dining 100 years ago and felt nice. The restaurant has the largest collection of long clay pipes (church pipes) in the USA. They are displayed on the ceiling and looked amazing.  Let's get down to the food. We didn't eat any appetisers as the steaks were huge. Both my kids and I ate T-Bone steaks that and were 24oz's. They were cooked to perfection. We had asparagus, spinach and fries for sides and that was plenty for 4 people. My wife had Sea Bass and again this was cooked well. We couldn't fit in desserts!  Overall it was excellent, food, service and experience. The only down side was the price, which for 4 people came up to $350. My wife had a glass of wine and I had a Keen's Ale, so a little pricey. But ask me the question would I go again. The answer is YES!"
"August 5, 2015",50,Excellent steak in nice surroundings,"My wife and I had a fantastic meal at Keens whilst visiting from the UK. The decor is really interesting and has a really nice relaxed atmosphere, the customers included family groups, couples and friends. Service was excellent, helping us to choose which steak best suited our tastes. The food was fantastic, steak was beautifully cooked and very tasty. Desert was absolutely huge and we could easily have shared one! Overall, very good and not bad value either compared to a similar establishment in London."
"August 3, 2015",40,Excellent Steak,"Kinda dissapointed , as I made this reservation a month ahead of time, asking for a main dining room table for our once in a lifetime visit to NY with our granddaughter and was assured they would take care of us. We got put in a corner upstairs. Put a pall on the whole evening. The steaks were fine, the service adequate, I would not go again tho, just ok."
"August 3, 2015",40,Interesting Good Experience,"We ordered mutton chop (their specialty) and T-bone. We could not finish everything so we decided to share the mutton chop and take home the T-bone. It's definitely their special and loved the dish. T-bone was ok, nothing stands out about it. The atmosphere is something different with all the pipes as decoration. There are room for improvement, hence the 4 star review."
"August 3, 2015",50,"Excellent, classic steakhouse","Visited Keens on Saturday night with my 11 year old. We had a fantastic dinner, by far the best filet mignon we have had in a long time! The service was good too. I think we could easily have shared the filet with the 2 sides that we ordered because it was a lot of food. My only complaint is that the seating can be tight. Our table had to be moved just to get around the table next to us. Other tables were a bit more private."
"August 2, 2015",40,Rare steakhouse close to Times Square,Ate here recently and enjoyed the old school steakhouse experience. Steak was thick and delicious and service was quite good. Would go back again.

"July 29, 2015",50,Best T-Bone ever,Visited with wife with lots of expectations. The place looks good. The waiter was great and gave us good recommendations. We took the T-Bone and one fillet. Both were great. The wine was good and so was the creme bruillet. Great experience.
"July 29, 2015",50,The best steak!,"The best steak! Yes. In a steakhouse you expect to eat steaks, but this one has been different: unique! the best one I've ever eaten in my life. Best than in South Africa or Argentina too. Really excellent!"
"July 29, 2015",50,Great atmosphere!,"Had dinner and we both had the steak. It was cooked to perfection. The only downside was that we both felt as though we were being rushed. Other than that, we had a great meal and will definitely visit again."
"July 28, 2015",40,Good steak and service,We ate on the third floor and the whole place was busy. The quality of the food is high and the service matches. Good wine list. Its pricey but I guess it is to be expected in Manhattan.
"July 25, 2015",30,Good but not that great,"Great atmosphere. Very good waiter. Everything was good, but I was expecting more. Had steaks as good or better in many places. If you order a baked potato at other steak houses you get many more condiments. Iceberg wedge salad was blah"

"July 15, 2015",50,Diner,"The best meet I have ever had before. Try mutton chop and prime rib. Absolutely delicious. With 2 bottles of Australian wine. By the way, they have the most wide Scotch Menu. We had single malt 15years Yamazaki."

"November 21, 2014",40,Savor the history...and the steaks!,We entertained friends visiting from LasVegas and they loved Keen's! The service was impeccable but friendly.

"November 19, 2014",50,What a treat!,"Last day in New York and found the best steak house. Look at the pub menu there are great meals on there too, and much cheaper!"
"November 17, 2014",30,Expected more,"Keen's is very traditional and has a long history of good steaks ! But for me it not achieved my expectations ! BIG steaks, high prices, but at least for me, could be more tasteful."
"November 16, 2014",50,Exellence,Wonderful dining experience. Elegant in every way. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Manhattan and seeking a classic steakhouse experience.

"November 15, 2014",40,Great Mutton,"Overall a great experience , my mutton chop was cooked great and tasted amazing but be mindful there is a lot of marble/fat on the meat which I enjoyed. The mutton and a manhattan is the way to go!"
"November 13, 2014",40,Traditional Steakhouse in the heart of mid town,Keens has the feel of a traditional steakhouse. Ideal place for meat lovers. Mutton Chop is highly recommended but you need to have 'some' appetite to finish it. Roasted veggies were sumptuous. Must visit if you are in mid town.
"November 12, 2014",50,Best steakhouse,"I'm a meat lover, and I can say that I've had the best steak of my life whilst dinning at Keens Steakhouse. It's worth a trip."
"November 12, 2014",40,Old steakhouse in the heart of manhattan,"Centrally located and one of the oldest restaurants in Manhattan's Keen's is an institution. The food was good, not great, the service excellent and they accommodated us upstairs which gave more room then Being squeezed into a tiny sitting area. Make sure you get reservations!"
"November 12, 2014",50,Perfect,Serious contender to best steakhouse in town. Steak was cooked and served to perfection. So were the other dishes. Definitely a place to come back to
"November 9, 2014",50,Oustanding steak,Keens situated close to Times Square is one of New York's oldest and most traditional steak houses. The quality of the meat is first class and added to the service makes for a special evening
"November 7, 2014",20,Steak over cooked & pricey,Very disappointed - very high prices would have expected a perfect steak but came overcooked ordered medium but arrived closer to well done - very disappointed - much better restaurants out there at half the price - AVOID - not worth it!!
"November 5, 2014",40,Great spot for business lunch close to Penn Station,Went here recently and had a delicious and well staffed business lunch. Menu is diverse and reasonable and it is a quick walk from Penn Station. Atmosphere is clubby steakhouse but in a friendly way.
"November 4, 2014",50,Still one of the best steaks in the world,"The first time I went to Keens was 7 years ago, and it was the best steak I had ever tasted. 7 years on it still holds that crown. Perfectly attentive staff and a great 'curiosity' style interior. I can't recommend this place enough."
"November 4, 2014",40,A NY Institution!,This Classic (it dates back to the 1800s) steakhouse serves a great steak in a clubby old school atmosphere. The service is professional and excellent. Nothing new or groundbreaking here - just good old fashioned meat and potatoes.
"November 2, 2014",50,"Delicious food, nice atmosphere","The T-bone was massive and delicious and creamed spinach the best I've tasted. Laid back, comfortable atmosphere. Highly recommend if you are looking for a good quality steak in this area of New York."
"November 1, 2014",30,Nice atmosphere quite expensive,I like value for money I don't mind paying for quality food but this restaurant was expensive! Lovely cocktail list and the fillet mignon was good. The pipes on the roof a nice feature but could do with a dusting!
"November 1, 2014",50,Best Steak Ever,"Very high quality meat cooked perfectly in an atmospheric restaurant with great service. Also, a superb wine list with very reasonable mark ups, less than 100% in comparison with most places which are 200%+. Not cheap but still great value. Will definitely go again."
"October 31, 2014",50,Super steak!,"Keens Steakhouse has one of the best steak ever! There I said it! so what are you waiting for, if you're in NYC, make your reservation now!"
"October 29, 2014",50,You Can't Go Wrong!,"Yes, it's busy in there, yes you need a reservation, yes it's cramped and dark - but the steaks are amazing. I found a single seat at the bar, had prime rib and have NO regrets! Nice wine list, great food, attentive servers - go!"
