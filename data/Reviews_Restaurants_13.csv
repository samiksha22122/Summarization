October 16, 2017,40,Love Italian,Visiting San Fran and found this spot on Trip Advisor so tried it. They were wrapped around the corner for a table. Good food and good service if you like Italian Food.;
;
"October 11, 2017,50,""Perfect pizza, great service"",Was here together with friends. Need to wait more than an hour for a table so we was thinking about finding another place. But the wait was well worth it!!! By far the best pizza I have ever tasted! Also recommend the meatballs :)";

"October 9, 2017,30,Just okay,""Since we are from NY, we tried the pizza. It was really no big deal. The crust was good, but not cheesy enough.""";

September 19, 2017,40,The best pizza,We stopped by the slice house one night for a slice of pizza. It was the best pizza we have had. We ended up there 3 times in 5 days. Very good.;
;
September 7, 2017,50,Freshly made,Pizza was fantastic. Tour guide told is about this place and he was not wrong. Hand made and fresh and Delicious!;
;
September 6, 2017,40,They have gluten free!!,Love that Tony's has gluten free options. They were able to make any of their pizza's gluten free too which is great. The only bad thing I would say is that there is no air conditioning in the restaurant.;
;
August 28, 2017,50,THE BEST,I wish I could give more than 5 stars...er... circles. Tony's Pizza is the best! I wish I could eat it every day until I got sick of it. Their slices are pretty cheap and freaking gigantic!;

"August 26, 2017,50,Great Meatballs and Pizza,""I usually don't rave about a lot of things, but I'm Italian and their Meatballs and Pizza were excellent. Sauce was just right. Highly recommend""";
;
"September 6, 2017,50,Probably the best pizza in San Fran,""Being from New Haven county, I'm a bit of a pizza snob. I'm very critical of my pizza, and I'm harsh. However, this place was surprisingly good. We were able to watch our pizza get cooked in front of us, so it was a great...More""";
;
"September 5, 2017,10,Save time and money,""The most over rated pizza joint ever. After waiting 30 mins for a table the waiter had such a bad attitude we should have left right there. After another 15 mins we got water and were told """"your drinks are coming when I get a minute."""" We got them and they were WRONG. Ordered our pizzas ($39 for one) and when they arrived they 25 mins later they were WRONG. one was to have extra cheese and anchovies and it had NEITHER! Save your time and definitely save your money! Go elsewhere. Oh, we made our displeasure about the atrocious service very clear to the waiter with tip. Want a good tip, prove good service.""";
;
"September 5, 2017,30,""""""Mexican Pizza"""""",""The staff at the Slice house was a bit rude and the pizza is now loaded with cheese, which I refer to as Mexican pizza, similar to a quesadilla. The ingredients are as always fresh but the quality is disproportionate. Tony is a great fellow and he deserves better.""";
;
"September 1, 2017,50,Amazing choice of fantastic pizzas,""By far the best pizza restaurant we have ever been in. This is not your usual pizza joint, some amazing and unusual pizzas on offer cooked in one of their seven ovens all of which cook in different ways. The lady who greeted us and showed us to our table must have been having a bad day but after that the service was quick, very proficient, slick and the staff could not have been more friendly or welcoming. We had two types of pizza both were superb. If you are visiting San Francisco you must pay a visit to Tony's.""";
;
"August 29, 2017,50,Best Pizza I have ever had...worth the wait,""No matter where you are from and what type of pizza you like, you will find a slice here to your liking. They have every style of pizza you can think of. My husband is from New Jersey so maybe it's no big surprise that both of us loved the New Jersey Tomato Pie. We also had the calamari and the garlic bread, both loved by the entire family including the kids. We tried the American pizza as well. Although it was good, just not my kind of pizza. We ate here twice during our stay in San Fran! I agree with the other reviewers, we were given a wait time of 45 minutes and we were seated in 35 minutes. Yes, the service is not refined or super friendly, but it's a great pizza joint and that's why it's so crowded..popular for a reason. Awesome atmosphere and good bartenders. Wish I had one here in Washington DC! If only I could get my hands on their recipe?!""";
;
August 28, 2017,50,Worth the wait!,We wanted to try Tony's and had one lunch we could fit in. We got there early to wait and make sure we got a table. We had an order of meatballs and a Margherita pizza. Both were excellent! We will come back on our next visit for dinner! I wish we had Tony's near us at home.;

"August 27, 2017,50,Unforgettable Sunday afternoon lunch at Tonys.,""Food is great, service is professional and proficient. I am an Italian food lover, I cook it a lot myself and loath the poor Italian food here in Sydney. Tonys was brilliant and just be patient with the wait. There is a park close by or LOLAS card shop down the road to help make time pass. I had pasta and it was brilliant. Wine and beer list really extensive and interesting as well.""";
;
"August 27, 2017,50,Amazing pizza,""Went to Tony's after hearing a friend rave about it. Was not disappointed. We knew the popularity so we got there about 15 minutes before it opened on a Saturday (it opened at 12). Already a line of about 30 people. Once it opened we were seated within 15 minutes. We ordered the meatballs and the Spicy Grandma pizza. The meatballs were incredible, and I'm not even a huge fan of meatballs. But the showstopper was the Spicy Grandma. They only make about 10 of these a day I believe. The sauce on this pizza was so unique but absolutely delicious. If you have the chance, get this pizza. So good! Expensive for a pizza, but so worth it. We had enough leftovers for both of us to eat lunch the next day! Can't say enough good things about Tony's. I will be dreaming about the next time I can go back!""";

August 24, 2017,50,Five stars from an Italian,We usually avoid italian restaurants outside Italy but we made an exception for Tony's pizza following the advice of a local Italo American woman. Pizza is simply and truly Italian level (obviously we took the Margherita Napoletana);

;
"September 28, 2015,40,""Very good, but not the best!"",The pizza's we ordered were delicious but by no means the best pizza I have ever had. Service was good and the waiter was great at explaining everything - who knew there were so many temperatures to cook a pizza!";
;
September 25, 2015,40,Fantastic Pizza,Went for lunch with friends while in San Francisco. Waited 45 minutes for a table but it was well worth it. Good service and great pizza.;
;
September 23, 2015,50,Best Pizza in SF,The wait was 45 minutes but COMPLETELY worth it. Plus they are in the 21st century and will text you when your table is available. Skip appetizers and save room for the pizza. Get the New Yorker. Amazing.;

"September 22, 2015,50,Pizza Heaven,""Being transplanted Michiganders, we had to try the Detroit style pizza. OMG!! It was soooooo good! The spinach salad was also delicious. Service was attentive without being too much.""";
;
September 15, 2015,50,Amazing pizza,Recommended to my by some locals that i knew. The best pizza i've had since my trip to New York years ago. It is a bit pricey for a couple slices so if that doesn't concern you should dine here.;
;
September 14, 2015,50,Great place,Margherita Pizza at it's best. Me and my wife were in the area for our daughters graduation and were walking through little Italy and came across this place. We sat outside on the street which is really the ideal location. The crust is absolutely amazing!;
;
"September 10, 2015,30,Not as good as the hype,""A nice funky place with very affable staff, but the pizza did not live up to the hype. We ordered the award winning New Yorker and it was quite bland. Still, pizza is a matter of taste......... Very nice hard cider though!""";

September 9, 2015,30,why famous?,it was just good pizza - can't understand it won prizes. the place were we go often here in brussels is so much better;
;
"September 4, 2015,30,A little extra?,""The pizza was great, but I found a larger chunk of wax paper in my pizza. Apparently it's what they use to separate the mozzarella slices. Mistakes happen and part of my pizza was comped, but I still wasn't thrilled with the experience.""";
;
"September 4, 2015,50,The best food we had in San Francisco,""This is a fantastic place in Little Italy, very popular with locals. Food was excellent and there's a great range of gluten free options.

August 18, 2015,50,Absolutely unique experience,If there was a six rating I would have rated this place at 6!!!!! Absolutely the best pizza I ever had ( we tried the New Yorker). Service was top. Waiters were smiling just before closing time. Highly recommended !;
;
August 16, 2015,50,Great pizza strong drinks,This place does have the best pizza in town. I always stop by when I am in town to grab a pizza. The booze is strong and the staff is great. The only problem is there is usually a 15 min wait.;
;
"August 16, 2015,40,Worth the hype,""Really good pizza, at reasonable prices and a slice is enough to fill you up. My only complaint was they had run out of most of the toppings when I ordered.""";
;
"August 12, 2015,50,DELIGHTFUL,""We had an amazing experience, loved the staff who where extremely friendly and attentive. I had the Margherita and was to spectacular!""";

;
"August 9, 2015,50,Perfect pizza,""Perfect pizza! The menu, pizza, and service were all great. Be prepared to wait for a table, but you can hang out in Washington Square Park while you wait. They will call you on your cell phone when your table is ready.""";

"July 28, 2015,50,Excellent Pizza,""Great pizza! Flavorful sauce, nice crust, fast service, moderate prices. Award winning pizza in North Beach, San Francisco. Go early, it fills up. You cannot go wrong.""";
;
"July 27, 2015,40,Extensive Pizza Menu,""Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for a table. Extensive menu of mostly pizzas. Kind of pricey. Portions are quite large. I've had better pizza elsewhere, but it's supposed to be an award winning place, so worth checking out.""";
;
"July 27, 2015,50,Outstanding Pizza Napoletana,""Wow, wow, wow! We were seven and ordered three pizzas. They were all delicious, but the Tartufo is a must! Excellent service and location made this a memorable meal. Take the bus or the cable car and walk around. Lovely!""";
;
"July 24, 2015,30,""Great pizza, but slow service"",""The pizza was excellent, a good size and reasonably priced. But we went during lunchtime, and had to wait half an hour for a table, and then another half an hour for them to cook our pizza.""";
;
July 23, 2015,50,One of the top pizzas ever,Many different options on ovens and styles of pizza...walked 2 miles from convention center worth every step...be prepared to wait for table and open seating at bar (bartender was phenomenal).;
;
"July 23, 2015,50,Tasty but impossible to finish,""The 'New Yorker' pizza (award-winning) was extremely nice but it was so big two people could hardly eat half of it! The crust was a bit on the hard side, though.""";
;
"July 21, 2015,50,Worth the wait,""This is the best pizza I have every had and the garlic green beans were great too. There are so many types of pizza to choose from we had the cali italia which had Gorgonzola, fig jam, balsamic glaze and Italian ham.""";
;
July 21, 2015,50,Great Pizza!,Our tour guide highly recommended Tony's for pizza while we were in San Fran. At 3 in the afternoon there was nearly a 2 hour wait so we couldn't get in....but they directed us to their sister restaurant next door...Slice....same pizza but take out. Delicious!!!!!;
;
"July 21, 2015,40,Pretty good pizza but not sure it was worth the wait,""This pizza place is pretty popular and there was a long wait list as they do not take reservations. When we finally sat down along the outside of the restaurant on a slanted street, we ordered a few pizzas and found them to be pretty...More""";
;
"July 21, 2015,20,Closed on tuesdays,""Tony's was highly recommended and we tried to go here, but alas, it was a Tuesday, and they are closed on Tuesdays. Oh well, you win some you lose some. However, I peeked into the window and the place was hustling & bustling. I observed some customers try to go in, but someone very rudely practically pushed them out and said that they were closed on Tuesdays. It looked like there was a private party, so I can understand the customers' confusion. Had there been a sign on the door that said """"closed for private party"""" it would have changed the perception of the customers. I haven't eaten here, so obviously I cannot comment on the food, but I was surprised at how rudely the potential customers were treated, and it made me not want to visit this place again. I suppose I'm sensitive as I have dear friends in the restaurant industry, and customers are precious as it is a fickle industry. Next time, if you are closed, be closed, but if you are having a private party, let us know that as well so there isn't any confusion.""";
;
"July 21, 2015,50,Worth the wait,""This is the best pizza I have every had and the garlic green beans were great too. There are so many types of pizza to choose from we had the cali italia which had Gorgonzola, fig jam, balsamic glaze and Italian ham.""";

;
"July 19, 2015,50,Really good pizza,""On the plane out west, my wife watched a segment about great pizza places across the country on the Travel Channel,mans the first one featured was Tony's. We came early in the evening, and we only had about a 10-15' wait (they will call your cellphone as you check out the shops and Washington Square nearby). It's possible to get almost any style of pizza here, and the menu tells you the type of oven and temperature at which each type is baked. For a guy who thinks Papa John's is pretty good, it gave me a chance to try some more adventurous ingredients, and Tony's staff didn't disappoint.""";
;
"July 19, 2015,50,Miss Margherita,""Waited a while on a Saturday afternoon to enjoy a pizza of legend. We ordered the Margherita pizza (they make only 73 per day because of the special dough) and were told‚Ä¶ your pizza is the second to last of the day! Surprisingly less than five minutes later a somewhat plain looking pizza arrived. My wife and I took our first bite. Instant bliss filled my mouth‚Ä¶ the dough divine, sauce simply super, magnificent mozzarella, and beautiful basil blended together in the best way imaginable. Till next time‚Ä¶ I miss Margherita!""";
;
"July 19, 2015,50,Authentic pizza at a great price,""Our tour guide recommended this place, and we were glad he did. The pizza was wonderful and very reasonably priced. We saw some other great looking dishes being served to other diners. We waited a short time for an indoor table (out of the San Francisco cold weather) and we were glad we did.""";
;
July 16, 2015,50,Amazing pizza!!,Picked the restaurant from Trip Advisor. Had to wait for table but nice n relaxed in bar to have a drink. Menu was really good with various pizza bases n toppings that were different. Pizzas were excellent. Would definitely recommend but go before you want to eat n have a drink when you wait for a table.;
;
"July 15, 2015,40,Good Pizza,""Place is located across the street from Washington Park, corner of Union and Stockton in the North Beach (little Italy) area. Our tour bus guide recommended this place as the best in SF. I can't vouch for that as I have not eaten in many places but the pizza here was really good. They even served my favorite, Sicilian slices- YES! However the place is always crowed and at least an hour wait. The good news is they have a take out place right next door so if you want to order a pie or slice to go you can either eat at the public tables outside or take it to the park across the street. Worth waiting for...""";
;
"July 15, 2015,50,""Great pizza, great atmosphere"",""We visited Tony's on the recommendation of another couple also visiting San Francisco. We arrived for lunch and noted that there was a bit of a wait so we asked if we could sit at their large bar. Not a problem, bar is first come first serve. Looking back, I'm super glad that there were no tables available because the bar is the place to be. The bartender is super friendly, personable, and welcoming. He was a huge part in making it an enjoyable experience. The other great part about the bar are the number of regulars who roll in and the relationships you can see that have been formed with the staff. We ate, we drank, we loved it. Menu is huge for a pizza place. It made it difficult to choose because there were so many amazing options. Oh yea, and when we did eat the pizza it was superb. If I lived in the city, I would definitely become a regular.""";
;
July 15, 2015,50,AMAZING PIZZA!!! Must go there!!!,Hands down the best pizza I've ever had! We got Margherita and New Yorker! Both were Perfection but Margherita was definitely the Best pizza I've had in my life! Hard to describe! Must try it to understand! Service in all aspects was perfect!;

;
"July 9, 2015,50,The pizza was amazing!,""Being Italian, we are very particular about our pizza. Some of us had the thin crust, and being Sicilian, I had the thick (Sicilian) one. Both were amazing! You can't miss out on this. The lines will probably be long, but worth it.""";

;
June 18, 2015,50,Great pizza,I know why some people say it's the best pizza anywhere. So good and fresh. The crust has to be the best I've ever had. A must stop to at least compare to what you think is good pizza.;
