26 June 2014,20,Overpriced for what it is,"The only thing we enjoyed about this restaurant was the customer service. Apart from that we did not find the meat tasty, nor well cooked. Apparently burgers are excellent... Really overpriced for the actual quality of dishes"
7 June 2014,50,Doesn't get much better,"Both the food and the service was immaculate. Service staff are knowledgeable about the menu, friendly yet polite and attentive. Plentiful choice of American, British, Irish meats for steak. The only downside is the bill, way too pricey for a regular experience."

21 February 2014,50,Great steak,This was my first time in a Goodman restaurant and I was very impressed. Great steaks though not for the faint hearted when you can get a 2.3kg ribeye (£172). Most around the £30-50 mark. Perfectly cooked as you would expect and busy until late.
4 February 2014,50,Unreal . Highly recommended,"How do I start this? ? I went to this venue with my friends and was blown away.. The food outstanding, drinks and atmosphere second to none. The steak unreal, better than any steak in a Gaucho. bvgMiss this venue you will really miss out."

2 February 2014,50,One of the best steakhouses in London,Simply one of the best steakhouses in London. The staff are fantastic and very attentive. Excellent bar too.
26 January 2014,50,Excellent!,"We had a great family meal here last night. You couldn't fault a single thing with this restaurant. Yes, it is expensive, but a lovely treat. :)"
23 December 2013,50,The best steak ever,Was recommended this place by a friend. I must say the food here is a little expensive but well worth the money. If you love steak then you WILL love this place. Save room for desert as that is fantastic too.
25 January 2014,50,"If you love steak .... this is very good, but expensive","This was our last night in London before returning home and we wanted a relaxing and delicious dinner with our daughter. Just a few steps away from the apartment we were staying in at Canary Wharf the location was super convenient on a wet, windy...More"
14 January 2014,50,A great steak house,"This was one of the top steak houses ever visited. The menu is concentrated on different cuts of meat ... Very good choice. Price is a bit on the high side but considering the meat quality, the service, the location and the atmosphere ..... Just go for the treat and forget the price :-) side dishes ... Go for the truffle chips .... desserts ... If I had more space I would have tried all :-) its a must at Canary Wharf."
12 January 2014,30,Ok ! Not as good as Gaucho,"Steak is ok, however not worth the price. I have eaten in many steak restaurants across London and I have to say I was quite disappointed by this one. For the price of the food the ambience reminds you of being in a pub, it lacks class and elligance. Parking is also another issue there is no where near by. For a better all round experience I would recommend Gaucho Canary Wharf, parking is also available there. Would I return ? Unfortunately not."
23 December 2013,50,The best steak ever,Was recommended this place by a friend. I must say the food here is a little expensive but well worth the money. If you love steak then you WILL love this place. Save room for desert as that is fantastic too.
21 December 2013,40,Quality steak!,"I visited this restaurant with a group of colleagues on a weeknight, and food was very well received by all. The service from our waiter was very welcoming and friendly. He took time to explained the different types of steaks and differences between each. The steak were very good - very well made and although prices are little on the high side. We also had 2 people in in our group that doesn't eat steak - one order the lobster dish and was said to be very well made. The other vegetarian colleague didn't find anything from the menu, and the chef made him a nice vegetarian pasta - was also said to be very nice by my colleague.  The only down side was that at end of the night, trying to find our coats from the cloak room was a problem."
17 December 2013,50,Simply the best,"Goodman CW does things simply, but very, very well. Service is a nice blend of friendly, cheerful and efficient. The food shows obvious attention to the most important details; the best ingredients, well cooked and attractively presented. My steak on the bone, cooked medium rare, [something I have never managed] was buttery, tender and delicious. The chocolate desert was equally good. The whole meal was simply the best I have eaten."
2 December 2013,50,The best steaks in London,"Goodman Canary Wharf is not ranked as high as some of the other steakhouses in London on several websites. This is baffling since what it offers rivals or surpasses its competitors. While it is true that its meat quality is about the same as other top establishments, when you combine the beautiful venue, the exemplary service and the great view, you cannot do better in this city. I personally love a spacious restaurant where you do not have to squeeze through tables to get to restrooms. Therefore, Goodman Canary Wharf must be rated among my favorites. The comfortable leather sofa stalls and the glimmering cutlery and wine glasses just make you want to sit there all night. It is located well outside the downtown area, so that is why it can afford its luxurious space and a lovely nighttime view of the wharf. It is easily accessible by DLR and about a 5-7 minute walk from there. The quay area is quiet and captivating at night, with some office buildings still having their lights on to illuminate the restaurant's exterior. As mentioned, the steak quality was excellent and was perfectly cooked. Sauces were delicious and sides were extraordinary. If you want great steaks, nothing beats Goodman Canary Wharf, and the friendly service adds to the overall experience."
30 November 2013,20,Not what it used to be,"I have eaten at goodman moscow (where this restaurant takes its roots from) and all their London locations and it usedto be one of my favorite ones. On two recent cw visits, I was dissapointed with the quality of the steaks (ordered the sirloin and the ribeye): they taste watery, not so much taste, so nothing compared to the amazing Hawksmoor, which is still my favorite steak in London."
25 November 2013,50,ONE OF THE BEST... IF NOT THE BEST!,"After many tries in a number of steakhouses, I finally found Goodman at CW. As my title states, one of the best if not THE best steakhouses I've ever been! Amazingly tasteful and good portion steaks (small portions seems to be a big problem in London!) Always fresh, always warm, always cooked AS ORDERED!!! Have been there at least 10 times, and not once my steak was cooked differently from what I asked!!! Many congrats to the chef... Many choices... long list of wines... excellent service! Every time I want to have a T-bone steak, Goodman is my choice."
23 November 2013,50,Consistently great food and service,We love Goodmans! The staff are friendly and really know their stuff. The meat is exceptionaly good and the choice of steaks can be a bit overwhelming. Ask if you can go and see all the steaks aging in the special room they have.  There is a great wine list (a bit pricey) and the bar staff make fabulous cocktails. Even if you sit at the bar and order burgers you will still have a great experience. And leave room for pudding - a small selection but all really good.
13 November 2013,50,Amazing,"This is one of the favourite place of mine to eat. Its just perfect, the food, service, atmosphere they all are incredible and best.... Keep it up guys ... Its just simply the best...."

2 November 2013,40,Excellent service and quality steak,This is one not to miss if you love steak and excellent service. It's not cheap but don't let that put you off as it's well worth it.
30 October 2013,40,Amazing steak... some of the time,"Goodman serves amazing steak (if you can afford it), highly recommended, although the quality can be hit & miss at Canary Wharf. The City branch seems to be more consistent. The creamed spinach and truffle chips are worth the visit alone!!"
20 October 2013,40,High end burger - just about perfect. :-),"First class burger and craft beer for lunch in Canary Wharf. Delicious chips, efficient service, and not too ££££. Beats Byron.... just"
18 October 2013,40,Very Good,"I've both eaten here and just sat at the bar, both experiences were very good. Especially recommended for business lunches/dinners, staff are friendly and food was good. Enough said!"
29 September 2013,50,Great steak!,"Great steak, nice atmosphere, great service (Ali did a great job!) Excellent wine list also! I'd also recommend a desert too, chocolate tort with the honeycomb ice cream was awesome! We will be making it a monthly trip i think..."

19 May 2013,40,Brilliant food and service,"Came after a recommendation from a couple of friends. Service was brilliant, and the waiters are really helpful in recommending which cuts to have and how to have them cooked. Only let down was the drinks, which were a bit overpriced."
9 May 2013,50,Best Steaks in London,My new favorite Steak restaurant. Pricy but the best steak I have had this side of the Atlantic. Waiter was attentive and Australia wine was great. Its a little pricey but worth it for a treat or a Business meal. We will return.
19 April 2013,50,"Great Steak, good business","Took some clients to Goodmans. Restaurant was excellent as was he food and service. Clients were from USA and commented how good the steak was, which is praise indeed."
15 April 2013,50,Best ever,There is nothing more to say than this will be the best meal you ever eat. The staff are faultless your mad not to experience Goodmans.
30 March 2013,30,Good but not great,"I was told to expect the best steak ever, but it was not as good as nearby The Gun (but better than Canary Wharf Gaucho). Also, very expensive for what it was."
16 February 2013,50,"Expensive, but best steak I have eaten in a long while.",The steak here is a treat. I could have cut my New York Sirloin with my fork. The service is first class and the wine list extensive. Expect to pay £40 a head plus though.
8 February 2013,40,Great Steak,"Small, but cool place. Good friendly staff, Fantastic Steak, do the Steak Tour, (which is basically standing inside a large fridge!!... chatting about Beef, but I like doing that). If you like steak you'll like Goodman's."

14 October 2012,40,Fancy a good steak?,"Generally I have found the standard of steaks in restaurants in the UK quite poor, but Goodman's reverses that trend. Choice cuts, aged etc., and a very American theme to the restaurant, but well worth a visit."
