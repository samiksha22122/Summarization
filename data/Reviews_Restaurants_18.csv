"February 5, 2019",50,Lifetime Destination,I have been eating at House of Prime Rib for years and always look forward to this place every time I travel to San Francisco. This is an old school quaint essential San Francisco establishment. The service is impeccable and the food is wonderful.
"February 1, 2019",40,Sorry guys.. I just don‚Äôt get it,I‚Äôm sure this could done a whole lot better.. Perhaps it was just an off day for me but I wasn‚Äôt feeling everyone else‚Äôs experience here.. the beef at Huntsman in Dunchurch is far better... Sorry again but won‚Äôt give it a second try

"October 7, 2018",30,More style over substance,The meat here is very good and you get very big portions but I have had better. We were served quickly despite the place being so busy that there was a 2 hour wait to eat at the bar.
"September 16, 2018",50,Excelent quality meat and service,Very good restaurant. The meat is incredible. Almost imposible to eat everything. The bread is fantastic. Also very good service.
"September 15, 2018",40,"good, tasty.","if you want to taste a good steak, this would be one of good choices. But a problem is you should make a reservation at least before a month you visit there"
"October 3, 2018",50,Meat lovers unite,"We had a group of 13 and were able to make same day reservations. So lucky! Had found this place on a list of the ‚ÄúTop Funnest Restaurants‚Äù in San Fran. And, indeed, it was. Simple menu but not simple ambiance. Food was delicious if...More"
"October 2, 2018",50,"It's Delightful, It's Delicious",I'm not sure I want to write a long review simply because the only things you want to know is that if you like meat and prime rib this is the place for you. Just.Plain.Epic. The only thing I'd change if I go back is to ask for less gravy on top.
"October 2, 2018",50,No reservation? Ask to sit at the bar,You will need to make a reservation well in advance and the experience is definitely better at a table but you can always sit at the bar. The cornbread isn't on the menu but if you ask for it they will bring it. The martinis are great and oh yes the prime rib isn't bad either. A great experience.
"September 30, 2018",50,it is PERFECT!!!!,"This restaurant is so old school, it should be teaching other restaurants how to do it great. We had a 7;30 reservation and were seated as soon as we came in. Service was prompt, professional and point on. Cocktails are strong, and wine by the glass is a good pore. No matter what size prime rib you order the portions are huge and the sides are also. I am fussy about my baked potatoes and when they loaded( butter, sour cream, bacon) it truly is and cooked perfectly.It's an excellent value, as the meal comes with the salad made at the table, bread, creamed Spinach, loaded potato or mashed potaoes BTW: the gentleman who handles the reservation and calls you back to confirm is very personable and a pleasure to do business with. LONG LIVE HOUSE OF PRIME RIB  Useful 1"
"September 26, 2018",50,A Prime Rib Lover‚Äôs Dream,"This restaurant has been on Van Ness for years, and always appears to be booked up. Despite diet trends in dining, there still appear to be meat lovers out there who know a value when they see it. For the price of just a slab of prime rib at a specialty steakhouse, you get an excellent prime rib with a huge, tasty salad (tossed table side), Yorkshire pudding, and generous baked potato / mashed potato. Service is extremely attentive, and the carving station by your table is both entertaining and convenient. There are children‚Äôs versions of prime rib, but few other dining alternatives on the menu."
"September 24, 2018",50,Touristy but excellent all-the-same.,"Fun service, excellent food, generous portions, The place was rather busy and somewhat loud but that did not detract from an enjoyable meal. We were a little confused about the sides and if there was an extra charge or if we had to pick one to share. They gave us everything we wanted and even more than we asked for for the included price."
"September 22, 2018",50,Best berf since Buenos Aires,"I never thought I'd taste beef as good as I enjoyed in BA, until here. Carved at your table, you just pick your cut. Meal comes with tasty salad, choice of mashed or baked potato, choice of creamed corn or spinach, and Yorkshire pudding. We brought our own wine as corkage fee was low. Our group strategy was to order largest cut and take half home. It was so good, I ate the whole piece. Service was prompt not pushy from friendly wait staff. They have a vegetarian plate available. I hear you want to reserve a table in advance. I know why."
"September 16, 2018",50,Excelent quality meat and service,Very good restaurant. The meat is incredible. Almost imposible to eat everything. The bread is fantastic. Also very good service.
"September 16, 2018",50,Best baked potato in the world!,"First time trying prime rib and and was a lucky girl to try it there. The sauce on the rib was so delish and seasoned nicely also the creme spinach was so nicely cooked, but what stole the night for me was their loaded baked potato, it changed the baked potatoe game for me! Baked potato standards are RAISED and I doubt anyone can touch House of Prime rib on that one."
"September 15, 2018",40,"good, tasty.","if you want to taste a good steak, this would be one of good choices. But a problem is you should make a reservation at least before a month you visit there"

"May 22, 2018",30,Below expectations,"Heard so much about this place, but it was ok and no more. The steak was very tender which is great, but lack of flavor.. also the desserts (crem brule & bread pudding). Not worth the money."
"May 6, 2018",50,Did not disappoint,Obviously this is a well known establishment in San Francisco. My wife saw it on TV one time and we always wanted to go. Finally got a chance this last month. Fantastic food and experience. I would go back.

"December 10, 2017",40,A FAVORITE,The food is excellent and the atmosphere is very lush and sophisticated. Somehow the waiter seemed to have added and additional $20 to our bill (on top of what we tipped!) and that has not yet been resolved.
"October 31, 2017",50,Amazing,We visited for a friend‚Äôs birthday for a special occasion. It was only a choice of which type of cut of beef you wanted but the wait was worthwhile - an amazing meal with amazing service. Highly recommended for anyone nearby!
"October 15, 2017",10,Worst of the worst,We expected fine dining.What we got was average food with a bunch of kids in t shirts and shorts.Noisy and obnoxious.So glad we didn‚Äôt bring quests we would have been so embarrassed.

"January 13, 2015",50,Worth the wait,"HoPR offers amazing prime rib, great sides, and great drinks. Service is friendly, and the ""all-in"" pricing is a bargain. We had a 90-minute wait for a table on a Tuesday--fortunately Gina the bartender and Aaron the waiter made the time fly."

Our waiter kept offering apologies for the delay in service....maybe just too many people. But, hey.....there's basically one menu item.

"December 3, 2013",40,Only place for prime rib in SF,"It's crowded, noisy, doesn't help to have a reservation, but once you get seated and the cart comes, it's all forgotten. Yes, you can have seconds, but to do so you would probably need to unbutton your pants!"
"November 15, 2013",50,"Prime Rib... Oh, so good","This restaurant is an annual tradition for our family.

"September 17, 2013",40,good piece of meat,This place has the perfect prime meat. If you can finish your meat and you can ask for more and is free. excellent gravy. But making a reservation is very difficult.
"September 9, 2013",40,A San Francisco Institution,Excellent prime rib! Superb service. But it's a tad expensive. Our bill averaged out to around $50 per person.
"September 6, 2013",50,Best Prime Rib,"The prime rib is great! I think you get a good deal for the price. It does get crowded, too crowded on the weekends, but worth it. I would however avoid going during holiday seasons."
"September 3, 2013",40,Very Good Not Incredible,"I think this restaurant is about a 8 or 9 out of ten. Food was good not bad. They need to spend more money on the seating fabric and update it, possibly to a burgundy leather to give it a more luxurious feel."
"July 31, 2013",50,MMMM Good!,"Service was simple and great...nothing showy, they get to the point and your food is served fairly quickly. Portions are great for the price. I enjoyed the sides but didn't focus on them as the prime rib was extremely juicy and cooked perfectly. A must!"

"June 24, 2013",50,Great service and meat,"The service was excellent, the portions were big and the quality was very good. Very accommodating. I requested the spinach saut√©ed with garlic instead of creamed spinach. Not a problem. Do reserve with time."
"June 23, 2013",50,Best prime rib anywhere in SF,I can't find a single negative with this restaurant. Where else can you go and get a generous slice of prime rib and all sides including their speciality salad for 40.00! It is best to make a reservation in advance.
"June 1, 2013",50,Pricy but she is worth it,"Great food, superior service, and lively atmosphere. You won't be disappointed. You need to make reservations. If you are a cable car traveler, need to take Hyde route and be prepared to walk up hills after dinner. Otherwise cab is best."
"June 1, 2013",50,Meat-lovers galore!,"The prime ribs here are the best! Tender, juicy and perfectly done, the salad, Yorkshire pudding and other accompaniments are also great. I especially love the convivial atmosphere and good service. A must-try when in the city! Will definitely return when I'm in town."
"May 28, 2013",50,Best Ever,If you like Prime Rib you will find none better than this 60 year old establishment. If you leave Hungry it is your fault.
"May 19, 2013",50,A must try when in San Francisco,I knew it would be great but it was actually better than what I expected. The most tender and melt-in-your mouth prime rib I've ever had was from this restaurant. Memorable and I would definitely try again.
"May 11, 2013",40,Who orders the fish?,"Even though we had a 45 minute wait (with reso) this reataurant is probably the most efficient operation I have ever seen. By the time you sit down, bread is on your table in two minutes and beef in your mouth within 7 min."
"May 5, 2013",50,"Great service, fun experience.","Wonderful, professional staff, excellent food. You can walk there from Castle Inn. The dining atmoshphere was worth the experience...white table cloths, fresh flowers on the table, with dim lighting, very romantic."
"May 19, 2013",50,A must try when in San Francisco,I knew it would be great but it was actually better than what I expected. The most tender and melt-in-your mouth prime rib I've ever had was from this restaurant. Memorable and I would definitely try again.
"May 13, 2013",30,Just too much food,"My experience of this place was somewhat tainted because it was our first night in SF and we were completely exhausted from a very long trip from the UK. However, I am confident that I would post the same review if I was to visit...More"
"May 11, 2013",40,Who orders the fish?,"Even though we had a 45 minute wait (with reso) this reataurant is probably the most efficient operation I have ever seen. By the time you sit down, bread is on your table in two minutes and beef in your mouth within 7 min."
"May 10, 2013",30,"Some good, some okay, some not-so-good...","Good (but not great) prime rib. It had better be, since that's pretty much all that they serve. Their preparation lacked the highly flavored and somewhat crispy ""lip"" that true beef lovers appreciate. But it tasted good and was obviously slow cooked with care. Mashed potatoes tasted pretty good, but were the consistency of soup. They were served with a brown gravy that wasn't awful, but had a commercial taste to it. The Yorkshire pudding was outstanding...better than any I have had, even better than in England. The creamed spinach was just NASTY tasting. How do you ruin creamed spinach? Easy...just load it up with nutmeg...NUTMEG?...really? Awful-awful-awful. Salad dressing (only one type available) was okay, but the salad itself contains watercress and pimento. We tried to order it without these ingredients, but we were told that we could not. We didn't like it very much. Terrific warm individual loaf of VERY fresh, crusty sourdough bread on the table. Out-of-this-world creme brulee for dessert. The service was excellent and very professional. I'm glad we went, but I wouldn't go back. For these high prices I expect more."
"May 8, 2013",50,Can't wait to go back,"Went to celebrate a birthday and it lived up to the hype. Prime rib was so juicy and tender and the sides were very good as well. Baked potato was HUGE and salad, creamed spinach, and yorkshire pudding were very tasty. The staff was very friendly and accommodating."
"May 7, 2013",50,THE RIB,"Place's packed....advanced booking is advisable.Only prime rib is served - who needs anything else??- huge portions of nice and juicy meat.Side dishes: salads,spinach cream are bottomless...Tasty gravy and potato pure√© as well.NIce people,great attention overall.If you don't get a reservation, go and wait at the bar...nice beers and wine selections,and really well-made drinks.Enjoy!"
"May 7, 2013",50,Last night treat,"Lovely old bar and restaurant we had to wait for a table we hadn't booked this place was busy and you can see why! Service was excellent beer and cocktails were very good. We were given warm crusty bread with butter while we waited for our meal then our salad came in a large iced dish that our server tossed at the table and dressed for us it was mouth watering. Our prime steaks were melt in the mouth cooked to perfection, My husband had mash and creamed spinach with his and I had a jacket potato served and dressed with the toppings at the table. The whole evening at this restaurant was perfect, meal, service everything. Where we sat was very noisy there was a large party in the same area as us but it didn't spoil our evening. Im sure if we had asked for a quiet area we would have been moved. A little expensive but well worth it, a wonderful end to a great holiday."
"May 6, 2013",50,"Got no ""beef"" with this place!","I have been to House of Prime Rib several times now. For me going out to dinner should be a multifaceted experience encompassing the food, service, atmosphere and fun factor. The first time I went I overdid it on the great warm sourdough and salad to start. Never again! I always want to be sure I have room for every last morsel of the excellent prime rib. The prime rib is cut and served to order at the table. I usually order the Baked potato as a side. This is a gigantic baked potato. As soon as our server loads it up with every imaginable topping I have them wrap it to go and it is my dinner the following night. One of the bonus features of this restaurant is the valet parking as finding a parking space in that area of San Francisco requires divine intervention. There is one small drawback and I almost don't want to mention it but if you are looking for a quiet subdued place this should not be your first choice. However, if you like a boisterous atmosphere with a lot of people having a great time, this is it."
"May 5, 2013",50,"Great service, fun experience.","Wonderful, professional staff, excellent food. You can walk there from Castle Inn. The dining atmoshphere was worth the experience...white table cloths, fresh flowers on the table, with dim lighting, very romantic."
"May 2, 2013",50,Will never like prime rib,"Anywhere else again! Had dinner with my husband and friends. Started by bringing us a loaf of hot sourdough bread...it was sooo yummy! All had various versions of prime rib, and one salmon. The prime rib was tender, juicy, and flavorful. Mashed potatoes, cream corn, and cream spinach were so good too. Honestly, we ate nothing that wasn't just delicious. A can't-miss!"
"April 19, 2013",50,Anniversary celebration,"We went for our 25th anniversary and it was amazing. The food was wonderful, our waiter Trevor was super and the atmosphere was great. If we ever get back to San Francisco, which I hope we do, we will definitely go back!!!"
"April 15, 2013",50,My Favorite,Been coming so many years and it doesn't disappoint from the great prime rib to the bread pudding. If you want a little extra just ask they will give you seconds upon request!
"April 14, 2013",50,Just; THE BEST PRIME RIB PERIOD,"From the moment you sit down; The food/service/drinks are top tier. They serve the best Prime rib I have ever had. Plus the salad tossed at the table, pop overs, cocktails are the best. Just the BEST"
"April 24, 2013",50,Perfect Roast Beef,Went to the restaurant with a group of friends and had a great meal. The roast beef was perfectly cooked. The wait person really made our experience more special. She was very accommodating to all our needs and even took a picture of us which...More
"April 23, 2013",50,A wonderful experience,"We were well looked after, all the way from cocktails while we waited for the group to assemble, to being given more than we ordered to take away after the meal.  The beef was succulent and tasty, the trimmings complemented well. Memorable were the three strengths of horseradish sauce!  Tip: Get that table booked in advance."
"April 22, 2013",30,"good, definately not great","first, let me preface this by saying that I live in Texas and am definately a beef eater. this was not the best piece of prime I have ever had before. there were 6 of us celebrating my birthday, and we had a great time. we had reservations, and were seated immediately as sonn as all were in the restaurant, and as one of my buds had brought a cake, that also was immediately taken care of. my issue was the inconsistencies of the served pieces of prime. admittedly, the roast is handcut, but my slice was definately not the same size of the slice next to me, and we ordered the same cut. disappointing. on the upside, the wine list is very moderately priced, and our service was excellent. I just hate to go to any restaurant and still be hungry after the meal"
"April 19, 2013",50,Anniversary celebration,"We went for our 25th anniversary and it was amazing. The food was wonderful, our waiter Trevor was super and the atmosphere was great. If we ever get back to San Francisco, which I hope we do, we will definitely go back!!!"
"April 17, 2013",50,Great find!,"Had a tour driver recommend this place and was grateful. Great service, excellent food carved at your table. Not a lot of menu variety, its prime rib in many forms or fish. Salad is tossed at your table. Choice of 2 sides, creamed spinach (with bacon) or creamed corn, both equal. Mashed or baked potato and of course yorkshire pudding to sop up alll the au jus. Would say you should experience it but you get a lot of food. Since we were staying at a hotel with no refrigerator so gave it to a VERY grateful homeless person, its there or in the restaurants trash."
"April 15, 2013",40,PRIME RIB,"and only primerib! THis is the place to go. It is remeniscent of a bygone era. Beef, potatoes, cocktails oh and a salad. Very retro so we blended in by ordering 2 manhattens. Haven't done that in a long time and it was excellent. The prime rib is cut to order (and size). We skipped the largest cut King Henry VIII for the smaller version. I had baked, my wife tried the mashed and we enjoyed the salad. My wie loved the veggies and I gave her mine (not a veggie person) The atmosphere was nice, casual and what I expected. Overall we had a good meal, a tad expensive but heck it's San Fransisco."

"April 13, 2013",40,The place to go if you like prime rib,"Very good and resonablly priced for a top end restaurant., I am a steak guy so prime is not my top choice but its all you can get here and it was very good. Nice salad and potaoe, plenty of food. Upscale bar, nice but kind of loud. Very good team service."
"April 12, 2013",30,It's Better than Average in Some Respects,"This restaurant enjoys the reputation of being the best Steak House in 'Frisco. I would acknowledge some of what it does is very good, but it's a mixed bag. The valet service for cars on arrival for $9 is fine as it's a busy part of town. The bar you can use on arrival is well serviced and we were ahead of our reservation time by 10 mins. The cocktails we ordered both different Martinis were great and brought to the table as we'e been moved on.The waiter was friendly and advised me about a good Napa red which I only wanted a glass or two of, not a bottle. The pre-attendance publicity had suggested that the meat was brought to your table and sliced to your direction and then cooked...inaccurate. There's what looks like a combined very miniature Airstream caravan and a Webber barbecue attended to by a chef who cuts fromm pre-cooked ribs of beef...not steak quite as I know it. I've eaten across the 'States and I've seen steaks that hang eithetr side of even large plates and I've also seen rare steak a vetenarian could have brought back to life! Their biggest steak was described as a King Henry V111 cut, it was bigger than the next cut down only because it included the bone, but was $8 dollars dearer...why, as there's no more meat involved? The starters were complimentary i.e. a medium sized Caesar salad which we hadn't ordered. It served/prepped at the table in a larger metal bowl spinning on an ice bed, which looks spectacular, but the salad dressing is very ordinary...The bread a small sour dough loaf was excellent.The accompaniments with the steak are mashed pots or Jacket with corn on the cob or spinach. The mash was passable...yes you can have tasty, creamy mash, but not necessarily here. Both the mash and spinach come off the 'Webber and weren't especially mad hot either! The jacket was served with a filling which I thought was pretty good. The steaks were very, very tender up there with the best, but I still argue as they were promoting size as well, that was a shortcoming. We opted out of desserts and had coffee...only warm not hot,again why? The bill was $250 for three people, two glasses of wine (not a bottle),two cocktails and a soft drink, no desserts...I reckon it would have had to have been a lot better to warrant that. It was goodish mostly, but not fantastic. The other info. suggested VERY smart casual dress, sorry it was casual and a a little bit smart here and there, not that it matters only by way of advice and misinformation beforehand. If I'm back in 'Frisco I wouldn't rush to return, but if you've money to burn go for it."
"February 25, 2013",50,Great dining experience,"We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals here. The prime rib was excellent and one of the highlights of DH's visit to the city :-)This place was bustling at 730 on a Tues night, so make reservations! Easy taxi ride from Union Square."
