"May 22, 2018",30,Below expectations,"Heard so much about this place, but it was ok and no more. The steak was very tender which is great, but lack of flavor.. also the desserts (crem brule & bread pudding). Not worth the money."

"October 9, 2016",50,Wow!,Terrific restaurant for having only one dish but with 3 choices on how to have it cut. Keep your expectations up because flavoursare unique. The only comment I would do is that they don't have wifi.

"September 19, 2016",50,Great food,It has been a few years since I ate and when I did it was very good and I enjoyed the prime rib I would totally recommend this place to anybody
"September 12, 2016",50,Lots of food,To say they feed you is an understatement. Standard meal gives you enough for 2 days for an average size guy. Prime ribs are large and prepped right at your table. Not to mention the nice size portioned sides. Two thumbs up on the meal.
"September 3, 2016",40,Delicious!,Delicious food! It was very loud though and difficult to have conversation. Make a reservation and bring your appetite. We will eat here again!
"August 22, 2016",40,Ribs as they should be,"Perfect meat, tender and juicy. You must order medium or well done, if you don't want to eat it very red. The side orders are very yummy. The mashed potatoes are delicious."
"August 22, 2016",40,Still the best prime rib,"Even after all these years, their roast beef is still roasted and cut to perfection, exactly to what you requested. The side dishes are large and well prepared. You always come away very satisfied and too full, and happy with the bill."

"June 21, 2016",50,Intense food experience!,"This was the high light of my San Fran eating experience. The meat selection is outstanding, and the quality is superb. I highly recommend treating yourself to this spot."
"July 14, 2016",50,Best restaurant we have been - fantastic prime rib,"Didn't really know what to expect but the reviews were so good thought we'd try. Absolutely awesome. Specialise in the prime rib and do it brilliantly! A bit pricey but worth every penny. Great staff, a bit of theatricals when making up the salad at...More"
"July 13, 2016",50,Just simply AWESOME!,"It is usually hard to give out five stars for anything, let alone someplace that can be a bit expensive and where you may not even expect value. However, The House of Prime Rib not only blew away every expectation that I had, but I happily paid the bill because this just was one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. Mind you I have been at some of the best steakhouses in New York, Chicago, had prime rib at the Original Lawry's in Beverly Hills, great meat when I lived in Texas, but The House of Prime Rib tops them all!  I say it is the best I have ever had as everything was fantastic! I went with my wife, daughter and cousins and just had a blast! My wife and daughter love prime rib and really do know what is good and is not. I knew we had a great meal when my wife made sure to let me know how good it really was.  I have to say everything started on the right foot when The House of Prime Rib allowed me to expand our reservation from 3 people to 7 just 24 hours before we arrived. My cousin found out that we were going there and made arrangements to bring his family from an hour away to join us! He had always wanted to go, so off we went!  Now mind you, this is not a cheap place, but when we finished I had to let the desk know that the meal I had was not only one of the best I (WE) had ever had, but I had no problem paying the $150 bill for the three of us since it was such value. Yes, value at a fancy, high end place! Oh, and with out all the snootiness you sometimes find at these places. Quite the opposite as everyone was super nice, accommodating and had one of the widest ranges of clientele that I have seen.  As for the food.... Everything was just wonderful! Our server and her assistants were terrific, very helpful when ordering, and always explained what was being served or answered any question we had. I was a bit taken aback when we received our salad as it was huge!  The prime rib was to die for! Wow, you could nearly use a fork to cut it since it was so tender. The creamed spinach had some kind of spice that put a bite on it, but it was really great none-the-less. If you like baked potatoes, go here! Dang the thing was huge! Interestingly enough, one of my cousins kids does not eat meat, but she was taken care of really well also as they had a beautiful King salmon for her. Her family was sharing it and it was just as good as everything else!  Bottom line is that this was a great place, albeit on the high side, but well worth it! Just make sure to make reservations! Can't wait to get back to San Francisco just to go back to dinner here!"
"July 12, 2016",50,Amazing Prime Rib!!!,"Ok...so obviously, you have to like prime rib if you're going to eat here. And if you do...this will be up there with the best you've ever had! It's super old school and the wait is long, but worth it...we grabbed a drink in the lounge area while we waited and wound up sitting at the bar, which I personally prefer. The drinks were great, the service was great and the food was even better! I can't say it enough...GO EAT HERE!!"
"July 4, 2016",50,"OF COURSE, WORLD CLASS PRIME BEEF, NEXT TIME, GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE LEISURE","Obviously, prime is their beef. The Henry VIII cut guarantees that if you still need more beef, they will continue to slice beef for you till you pass out, so if your favorite grandchild plays rt tackle for Stanford, this is his dish. Their sides are excellent, espec the creamed spinach, baked potato is enormous No need to upgrade to a larger cut of prime rib and the regular cut is fine:P I did a bit of an upgrade at the suggestion of the waiter(+ $3.00) for an item where they thin slice three pieces of prime rib, his suggestion being that some folks find the flavor of the thin cut is better than that of the full cut: after the meal, I agreed and recommend this alternative. My only criticism is that I felt we were ever so gently rushed, especially when we ordered our cocktails we asked for time before the salad course(included in the price of the dinner) was served: we were only half way through our cocktails when the salad was served, but of course I suppose this is a restaurant where one eats and does not dine: though they are not lacking in business, for me, this will be my first and last time at the restaurant, and they can defend their policy by pointing to the crowds at the door when the place opened its door that night."
"June 30, 2016",40,Make Sure You're Hungry!,"This was our second time we went to The House of Prime Rib. Like our previous visits, the meal tasted great. The menu isn't extensive but this made it easier for us to choose. I had the city cut prime rib dinner, while my boyfriend had the English cut. Both of our meals tasted great. When we ordered, I thought that the meal just came with a baked potato, which can be cooked other ways, and a choice of one of two vegetables. The meal also comes with sourdough bread to start, salad before the main, and freshly made Yorkshire pudding with the prime rib. As with many of the customers, we ended up taking the leftovers home. I also enjoyed the seasoning so much, I bought two bottles to take home! The ambiance is louder than usual and my only complaint is we felt slightly rushed throughout the beginning of the meal. Otherwise, the price was very good for the amount of food that we got. The restaurant is out of the way from most hotels, but it's easily accessible from the cable car on California street and just a short walk from the stop."
"June 30, 2016",40,Devine Prime Rib!,This is a very busy very loud place! It's actually quite well planned out as there are several foods that come with the prime rib You just choose your cut of meat and you get all the sides. Seems to be a fair price for what you get. It was a fun evening and fairly priced.
"June 27, 2016",40,"A wait, delicious food and no lingering",Either call ahead or be prepared for about 45-60 min wait. The food is delicious with huge portions and moderately priced. If you enjoy a lovely grilled piece of prime rib... Stop! Look no further... It's here.
"June 27, 2016",50,Great ribs,"Typically not a fan of such restaurants as I find their meat pretty bland. However, they offer the Kings Sear, which they seat both sides of the prime rib, marinated with salt and pepper.  The taste is pretty incredible and you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for it.  Definitely a must go to joint in SF"
"June 25, 2016",50,I will dream about this dinner for a long time...,"I can tell you that you will unequivocally never, ever, have a better slice of prime rib (FYI- don't be afraid to order ""rare""). Everything about this spectacularly hedonistic experience was superb. The service and ambiance is classic and excellent. However, the star, by far is the food. From the meat, to the generously portioned sides, to the desserts, everything was delicious. I was so pleasantly surprised at how good everything was. Even with the huge portions, I was enjoying everything so much that I finished everything. I hope to return MANY times in the future!"
