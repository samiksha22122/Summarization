The staff were great, attentive but not overbearing nor patroninsg. Great fun making the steak ourselves at the table. We each had main +...More"
8 May 2016,50,What a great way to eat steak,"We both chose fillet steaks, I had garlic butter, sea salt and pepper sauce. My husband had garlic butter, chilli and mushroom sauce. The meat comes rare-ish on a hot skillet. You then continue to cook it to your liking. I loved this! I just cut pieces off and cooked each one as I went. I had regular French fries and we had some onion rings too. It was such a surprise and by far our cheapest meal in London, even with a bottle a wine. The staff were amazing friendly and were great at making recommendations. Next time I'm in London I'd definitely head here again. Thankyou!"
8 May 2016,50,Amazing!!!!,Thank you to Carlo who looked after us yesterday! That was by far the best steak we have ever had! Will definitely be back.
7 May 2016,50,Pre-theatre lushness!,"We ate here on a busy Friday night before the theater and it was superb!  food - Steak comes with 3 cooking aids. Butter, (flavoured) salt (flavoured) and dipping sauce. It is presented on a plate, with a hot (read volcano type hot) stone for you to cook it to you taste preference. you slice the steak, rub your butter on it, place it on the stone and it cooks, steams and hisses at you, as you sprinkle salt on the side not stone down. When done, you dip in the sauce and eat away! The steak might go a bit cold on the plate but the stone cooks and heats it well. Sides are ordered separately to the steak and are also excellent.  seating - quite close together but not so much that you are rubbing elbows. There was a long queue outside by the time we had finished, but they all seemed happy to wait for a table.  Staff - very knowledgeable and attentive. Timely delivery of food, well explained and polite.  Ambiance - it is noisy and buzzy and we did not notice anyone who looked grumpy. Fun place to eat, particularly if you need an energy pick up!  Will definitely return."
7 May 2016,30,Early Saturday Dinner,We were looking for a restaurant to go to before heading off to a chocolate making experience in another area of London and had been recommended Steak & Co by a family member who had recently visited another location. The restaurant is quite small and was quite busy even when we were dining at 5pm. The seating arrangements are quite snug so I wouldn't attend if looking to have a private conversation! However the staff were excellent even with a packed restaurant and the steak was delicious. When the food arrived initially the fries were cold where the food had obviously been sat waiting- this was not an issue as as soon as mentioned to our waiter fresh fries were delivered to our table. I had the sirloin strips steak which was cooked perfectly and delicious. My partner also enjoyed his steak. The sauces and butters that you can choose are a great addition to your meal. I would probably visit again but as there are so many restaurants to try in London I wouldn't necessarily rush back straight away!
7 May 2016,50,Excellent!,"Really good restaurant, delicious meat, we were served by Carlo which was really helpful and perfect in explaining us the dishes."
6 May 2016,50,Superb meal,"Called in the off chance for a meal for my partner's birthday as it looked inviting from the outside and my partner loves steak. We were waited on by the very attentive Carlo, who attended to our every need. The steak arrived medium cooked on a hot stone to allow you to then cook it to your liking along. I had the seabass, which was cooked to perfection. At the beginning of the meal I had mentioned it was my partner's birthday and so, before settling the bill, Carlo arrived with a small ramekin of gelato with a candle lit and he and another waiter sang happy birthday, which all the restaurant joined in. My partner was thoroughly embarrassed but it was a really lovely gesture and I look forward to a return visit very soon"
3 May 2016,20,"Good food, you cook yourself, poor servce","My wife fancied steak so we used trip advisor which recommended here. The food was good, it's not served cooked, it's seared and you do the rest. Therefore the table soon gets a little greasy. However the biggest disappointment was the poor service, the waitress couldn't wait to get rid of us. Bearing in mind we were paying almost ¬£100 for two id expect, for example, to not have a drink mat re over from under my wife when she picked up her glass, or for the table to be readied for the next person whilst we are still eating. The following day we paid similar money at the oxo and they treated us with respect. Won't be going back here."
2 May 2016,50,A special birthday visit,"We were a party of 11 and went to celebrate a special birthday here. When we arrived the staff were very welcoming and allowed us time to look at the menu rather than quickly jumping on us for drinks. From looking at the website beforehand, I was aware of the ""procedures"" regarding the Steaks and this did make me want to try one out. I, personally, had the Peppered Steak and I do have to say it was one of the best I have ever had. You are presented with a Rare steak and a special stone in which you use to finish of the cooking of the steak so that it is just how the diner likes it. I was surprised at how hot this stone stayed throughout the meal. At the end of the day, yes, I could do without the DIY aspect however this is their niche in a crowded market and does positively impact the dining experience.  The Chocolate Orange Cake, which I had for pudding, was outstanding and wasn't like any other I had tasted before; I would really recommend that dish!  A quick note about the staff at the Garrick Street branch; they are all amazing. I wasnt able to get the guy's name but our waiter (with the brow piercing) was brilliant. Everyone was Sir or Madam and nothing was too much trouble for him. He looked like he truly loved his job and made sure we all understood how to cook the steak.  Faultless."
23 April 2016,40,Peter-very helpful and attentive waiter,"We ate here before going to see a play,Peter helped us choose a wine and explained about the wide choice of steaks and sauces available.We didn't have to wait long for our meals even though the restaurant was quite busy.What a novel way to serve steak !!!A very enjoyable experience. When we got home I noticed the ""cover charge "" What's that about???"

21 May 2013,30,Disappointing,The rump steak was rather chewy and nothing special really..I expected better as I've always wanted to ty steak on a stone. Rather pricey too
7 May 2013,30,Friday evening meal,"I enjoy the steak & Co it is clean, fresh and hot food. My partner did not enjoy his as it was hunters chicken but in a bowl? Which was like a soup."
29 April 2013,50,mouth watering,I happened upon this delight by accident. The meat is top notch and they bring it to you on a platter with a hot stone where you proceed to finish cooking it yourself. Wonderful meal.

22 February 2013,20,Forget about this place,I visited this place on saturday evening: only 2 table were occupied. As I entered no waiter was available in the restaurant and I went as far as the kitchen to find one. The atmosphere was cold. The service though quick was very basic and...More
15 February 2013,40,Fantastic steaks,I love this place. The steaks are top notch considering that tourists to London seem to be the main clientele. Every time I have visited it has been busy and have had to wait for a table but it is well worth it. Steaks brought to the table on a stone are beautiful and tender . Not bad price wise either especially for London.
8 February 2013,10,Major disappointment and RUDE service,"A few months ago a friend and I were passing Steak and Co near Leicester Square. We decided the place looked nice from the outside so opted for lunch there. On arrival we were great quite fast and seated at a window seat. To our disapointment we were sat at a table that was so dirty we didn't want to touch it. I requested it to be clean and finally they cleaned it (with a side order of attiude) but only wipe half the table to the right hand side was clean and the left hand side was still dirty. I ended up cleaning it myself.  we placed our order: 3.27 took order 3.32 drinks arrive 3.34 ribs arrive  So the food getting to the table was in a good time and was very nice. The meal was good and enjoyable but it was also a shame that 3 tables over ordered a sizzling dish and the entire restuarant filled with smoke and everyone was couphing. I know this is not really thier fault but a premises design  one thing at we both found really annoying is that there were only two staff on. One of the guys there was running himself into the groound trying to serve every table himself and the other guy, i can only imagine he was manager (by the way he acted) was only greating people at the door and then sitting down chatting to friends. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! he never once lifted a finger to help the other guy. Honestly Steak and Co this guy is a waste of time and a liablitiy as you are loosing money because of bad service.  overall i would say the food was nice but the service has put a big red Cross on this place and I will not return and spend my hard earned money there."
25 January 2013,30,Great steak but service lacking!,"Went for a day out in London with my husband, we had steak & co recommended to us, so were looking forward to a good lunch. Booked a table as wasn't sure how by it out be only to find the restaurant empty when we arrived. It took sometime before the waitress come over to serve us and was then surprised when we asked her to explain how the sizzling plates came out. The food took quite some time to come out however my steak on the sizzling plate was gorgeous. The drinks were a little pricey for a chain restaurant. Went to order dessert but they didn't have our favourite left. The waitress argyle came to chck on us and we had to ask her to take our plates away as they were sitting there empty for a good 20 minutes.  All in all good food but don't expect great service"
4 January 2013,20,"Good steak, poor service.","We visited Steak and Co. on 4/1/2013, arriving about 14:30. The restaurant was quiet, only about a third full, but we still had to attract the attention of the staff to ask whether we should choose a table or wait to be seated. We chose and the order was taken promptly. Within ten minutes, four more tables had been filled. Ten minutes after this one table left as no one had bothered to take their order. Another table left after five more minutes of the same treatment. Half an hour after placing our order, I enquired as to how much longer our food would be and was informed that it was on its way. Apparently, it had taken so long because our steaks 'had to be cooked' as we had asked for them on plates - an option given on the menu - as opposed to sizzling them ourselves on their stone platters.  This seemed like a poor excuse as both steaks had been ordered medium-rare. Even if we'd asked for them to be cremated it shouldn't have taken that long (memorial service included!!)  The steaks (one rib-eye, one fillet) were good, but at ¬£19.50 for the 8oz fillet and around ¬£18.00 for the 10oz rib-eye you would expect them to be. (These prices are for the steak only and do not include fries or any other accompaniments). Another member of our party ordered a variety of starters rather than a main: each of these - calamari, chicken wings and potato skins - were just 'ok'.  When enquiring as to whether we wanted to order dessert, we made the point that we had planned to, but had unfortunately run out of time as we had a train to catch. At this the waiter suggested we allow ourselves more time next time!!! Unbelievable.  We then got the bill, only to be charged for fries that we hadn't received. This was soon sorted, but the whole leaves me unable to recommend this restaurant, especially if you have less than two hours to spare."
1 January 2013,50,Excellent Steak,"Probably one of the nicest steaks I have ever tasted. Good central location, 5 mins from Leicester Square. Very busy as it's just after Xmas, but still good service & friendly atmosphere. Will definately visit again."
25 December 2012,40,Nice location just off Leicester Square,"All in all, a nice dinner. Lots of good steaks and a few vegetarian options. We ate on Christmas day so they apologized that they had run out of some things because of the lack of deliveries. Staff was very nice. Onion soup was a bit bland but not bad. Sizzling steak platers is a nice touch. Limited beer selection. Desserts were good but not extra ordinary."
22 February 2013,20,Forget about this place,"I visited this place on saturday evening: only 2 table were occupied. As I entered no waiter was available in the restaurant and I went as far as the kitchen to find one. The atmosphere was cold. The service though quick was very basic and it seemed the waiter wasn't interested with his customer. My steak was ok but the mush potatoes were dry and tasteless. No bread was served nor offered. I was looking forward to a nice dinner with a nice steak but I found myself disappointed. For sure I don't recommend this restaurant, although from the outside looks pretty nice."
15 February 2013,40,Fantastic steaks,I love this place. The steaks are top notch considering that tourists to London seem to be the main clientele. Every time I have visited it has been busy and have had to wait for a table but it is well worth it. Steaks brought to the table on a stone are beautiful and tender . Not bad price wise either especially for London.
8 February 2013,10,Major disappointment and RUDE service,"A few months ago a friend and I were passing Steak and Co near Leicester Square. We decided the place looked nice from the outside so opted for lunch there. On arrival we were great quite fast and seated at a window seat. To our disapointment we were sat at a table that was so dirty we didn't want to touch it. I requested it to be clean and finally they cleaned it (with a side order of attiude) but only wipe half the table to the right hand side was clean and the left hand side was still dirty. I ended up cleaning it myself.  we placed our order: 3.27 took order 3.32 drinks arrive 3.34 ribs arrive  So the food getting to the table was in a good time and was very nice. The meal was good and enjoyable but it was also a shame that 3 tables over ordered a sizzling dish and the entire restuarant filled with smoke and everyone was couphing. I know this is not really thier fault but a premises design  one thing at we both found really annoying is that there were only two staff on. One of the guys there was running himself into the groound trying to serve every table himself and the other guy, i can only imagine he was manager (by the way he acted) was only greating people at the door and then sitting down chatting to friends. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! he never once lifted a finger to help the other guy. Honestly Steak and Co this guy is a waste of time and a liablitiy as you are loosing money because of bad service.  overall i would say the food was nice but the service has put a big red Cross on this place and I will not return and spend my hard earned money there."
25 January 2013,30,Great steak but service lacking!,"Went for a day out in London with my husband, we had steak & co recommended to us, so were looking forward to a good lunch. Booked a table as wasn't sure how by it out be only to find the restaurant empty when we arrived. It took sometime before the waitress come over to serve us and was then surprised when we asked her to explain how the sizzling plates came out. The food took quite some time to come out however my steak on the sizzling plate was gorgeous. The drinks were a little pricey for a chain restaurant. Went to order dessert but they didn't have our favourite left. The waitress argyle came to chck on us and we had to ask her to take our plates away as they were sitting there empty for a good 20 minutes.  All in all good food but don't expect great service"
4 January 2013,20,"Good steak, poor service.","We visited Steak and Co. on 4/1/2013, arriving about 14:30. The restaurant was quiet, only about a third full, but we still had to attract the attention of the staff to ask whether we should choose a table or wait to be seated. We chose and the order was taken promptly. Within ten minutes, four more tables had been filled. Ten minutes after this one table left as no one had bothered to take their order. Another table left after five more minutes of the same treatment. Half an hour after placing our order, I enquired as to how much longer our food would be and was informed that it was on its way. Apparently, it had taken so long because our steaks 'had to be cooked' as we had asked for them on plates - an option given on the menu - as opposed to sizzling them ourselves on their stone platters.  This seemed like a poor excuse as both steaks had been ordered medium-rare. Even if we'd asked for them to be cremated it shouldn't have taken that long (memorial service included!!)  The steaks (one rib-eye, one fillet) were good, but at ¬£19.50 for the 8oz fillet and around ¬£18.00 for the 10oz rib-eye you would expect them to be.
