"January 8, 2018",40,Solid steak,"The sides (zucchini and king oyster mushrooms) were perfectly tasty, but the steak itself (both the ribeye and tenderloin) were a bit dry and overcooked. Make sure to err on the rarer side when you order"
"January 5, 2018",50,Lived up to it's hype!,We had a wonderful Argentine steak dinner at Don Julio. Thank goodness that I booked this reservation well in advance as the wait list was out the door. Wonderful ambiance and excellent service.
"January 3, 2018",40,"Good, but expensive.","For the same price, you can have a better experience. Food was very good, the 'Provoleta' (cheese) was great, but the table and chairs looked somehow too old to me. They could revamp a little bit the place."
"January 2, 2018",50,Great meat,Great meat great wine must reserve especially to get outside table. Argentina meat.is the best. Not cheap but worth it
"January 6, 2018",50,Authentic Argentinian Steakhouse,"We went here on our first night looking for an authentic Argentinian steakhouse.

If you are looking for more creativity, recommend...More"
"January 6, 2018",50,Tender Steaks,"We walked in on a Saturday for lunch without a reservation. This place is bigger than it looks but it is also very popular (many tourists). Very friendly and efficient service. The steak (bife de lomo = tenderloin) was very tender, cooked just right ... in other words ""perfect"". We also liked the vegetables and they offer a great selection of wines. Good value for money."
"January 5, 2018",50,Lived up to it's hype!,We had a wonderful Argentine steak dinner at Don Julio. Thank goodness that I booked this reservation well in advance as the wait list was out the door. Wonderful ambiance and excellent service.

"January 3, 2018",50,What a place,This restaurant is a must visit if you have a few days in Buenos Aires - focus is on meat in all Various cuts and excellent wine.  Highly recommended but be patient there is normally a wait outside but the feed you and give you drinks. Really cool place.
"January 2, 2018",50,Delicious steaks but arrive early!!!,"Logistics:  We were there at 7pm and lucky enough to be one of the people who got seated in the first round (around 7.15 or so we got to our table). If you miss this, you are in for a long wait - at least with a good supply of bubbly and I think I also saw bits of meat being passed around but I recommend you arrive early maybe even before 7pm to make sure as I personally would not like to wait for an hour and a half possibly more and have a very late dinner - especially if it's as big as this. We left at 9.15 or so and the queue was getting longer and longer in the last two hours.  Food:  We were here to eat steaks and so we skipped all else and went for a rib teye and fillet (about 1kg+ meat in total!). We ordered rare as we thought this corresponds to what I think is medium rare (we tried medium rare few nights ago and it was overcooked for my taste). Rib eye was one of the best I have eaten. Really delicious. To be honest fries were great too but just too much, so if you'll go for two steaks for two people I recommend having a salad or something lighter as a side.  We skipped wine so can't comment on that.  Service:  Really nice gentleman helped us. He was patient and answered all questions. Despite the queue at no point I felt that we were being rushed to leave, which was very professional.  The only negative:  Well, tourists and waaay too many of them (us too, but still!). I think the whole restaurant was full of them. It's weird. I like to sometimes hang out where the locals go if I visit a city. But it's not the restaurant's fault. And I felt it was less intense for us as we chose to sit outside.  The steak was delicious and on that basis, definitely worth a visit but try and beat the queue!"

"January 1, 2018",50,Vibrant and excellent throughout,"Loved this restaurant. Very vibrant, big crowd with all tables filled for what seemed like 3 seatings. We were seated on time, provided with a glass of sparkling wine when we arrived. Very good service throughout the evening. Langostine starter absolutely delicious, as were all of the steaks we had. Huge standouts were two desserts, the chocolate moose which had a nut and caramel corn type topping, also the strawberries with sabayon sauce. Would love to return."
"January 1, 2018",50,Best meat ever!!!,"We received a lot of tips when we went to Buenos Aires and Don Julio was one of them. We had lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was absolutely amazing!!! People said the meat was so lean you could 'cut' it with a spoon. We did not try this, but it is certainly believable. Definitely worth a visit and the wait if necessary. Try to reserve in advance, if not you have to wait outside for at least half an hour. During the wait they give you a glass of cava, very friendly!"
"December 31, 2017",50,Best steak in Buenos Aires I have ever tried,"Don Julio is absolutely amazing steakhouse of local Argentinian Style! La Carne just simply melts inside your mouth with juice spilled out . Your entire feasting buds will be assisted by the succulent Parrilla! The salad is a big big plus as well since in general i don’t like the salads provided by the Argentinian steakhouse that much, however the tomato salad they recommend completes broke my previous impression, the tomatoes were so sweet and juicy like fruited and served in both rojo and amarillo which could captive your vision as well. Last but not least, the Great service beats the rest of the steakhouse including wine-selection, accommodating plate-changing, friendly introducing all the menus with fluent English."

Really enjoyed this place and would be happy to return if i make it back to buenos aires.

We came in a group of 5 - everyone ordered a different dish (mostly steak), and then we shared it with some nice wine (go straight for a bottle). It was really nice. Not the best steak ever, but way above average (waay above average). And the service? Friendly ladies with hearth warming smiles! You can't ask for nothing more in such a simple place.  Average price per person was under 200 pesos and we all were pretty full. We just went for some sweets afterwards, but not because of hunger.  I would recommend it, no questions asked! So if you're around and would like a nice steak for reasonable price - you're in for a treat!"

"May 7, 2015",50,Wonderful emersion into the culture of Buenos Aires/La Boca/Argentina,"Arrive in Buenos Aires the first time in March 2015. Friend in the area suggested that we visit La Boca prior to my business trip really starting the next day. We walked the area, then arrived at El Gran Paraiso for dinner.  The courtyard dining was a wonderful treat. Not too hot or cold. We decided to dine family style and share all the dishes. I tried the blood sausage, chorizo, sirloin, etc. Everything was wonderful. It was fun to watch the grill and see all the cuts of meat being cooked. Most cuts come medium by default, if you want them more rare make sure to tell your server.  I would have been completely lost without my friends that translated. That day no one of the staff spoke English. I am so happy I went to experience the culture that is on display in La Boca."
"March 18, 2015",50,"Great food, people and atmosphere!","Luckily, we got a recommendation to come here from an artisan in La Boca, Buenos Aires. We, and our two friends needed a little break and a snack from walking around in the heat and selected a table on the lovely terrace in Gran Paraiso. Our waiter was smiling and friendly and tho we only had a snack of chorizo, empanadas and cold beer, it was a delightful little repast. Bill, one of the proprietors, engaged us in lively conversation and we felt totally at home. The food and beer were delicious, but even better was how at home we felt. I only wish we had been in the area for a main meal, because you are greeted with the most enticing-looking and aromatic barbecue when you enter the patio. I will make it a priority to return here the next time I'm in BA. Thanks Bill and staff for a great moment in our BA visit!"

"April 2, 2014",50,Don't Miss this Hidden Gem off the main drag of La Boca,"We stumbled upon El Paraiso when walking around La Boca and clearly made the best choice possible. Extra friendly staff and owner/proprietor Bill. Our waiter was Eduardo and he was top notch. Grilled meats to order in super large quanities! We could not eat everything! But what we did eat was delicious. Excellent wine list and also excellent beer for the beer drinkers. During the lunch hour they had an excellent guitar player who had a wide range of songs for easy listening. Out of the way of the hustle and bustle that is La Boca. We ate there three consecutive days for lunch. Every day was better than the last. Great for families, couples and celebrations!"
"March 26, 2014",50,A gem in a touristy area...don't miss it!,"Walking the old railroad tracks, we were sucked in by the delicious smells of barbeque. It's a lovely courtyard, in which a guitar just seems right. Not overwhelming, but just right. Prices, service was all just great. Walk by all the touristy places and go around the back. Don't miss it."
"December 22, 2013",50,Amazing hidden gem of a restaurant in Boca,"How no one has reviewed this place I have no idea... It is amazing and I can't imagine there being a better place to eat, particularly for lunch in Boca. The restaurant is hidden away in a very large garden shaded by trees and umbrellas. Unlike all of the other tourist traps in the area, you are not ushered in at all or given the hard sell. It really did just seem to be full of locals and a few lucky tourists.  The food is pretty much all centered around a parilla (BBQ meat) or salads. The choripan was excellent.  Again, unlike the cheesy tourist tango shows on the street round the corner, there was a guitarist playing here for the diners who was absolutely fantastic. Not only was he an amazing guitarist and singer but he also gave a lot of history and detail all about the tango songs that he was playing. Nobody was actually dancing tango though. It was all explained in Spanish though.  Anyway, this is an incredible place to stop for lunch in Boca. I have no idea if it is open for dinner or not though. An absolute gem. Do not waste your time going anywhere else for lunch in Boca..."
"May 20, 2015",50,Delightful place!,Our city guide took us here during our visit of La Boca. We loved the ambience. Seating is outdoors. The meats are grilled right there at the entrance. Like the way the herbs and other things are placed as way of decor. There was also a singer belting out lovely songs. We had chorizo which was great but didn't particularly like the blood sausage. It was the first time we had the blood sausage. The pork ribs were good but too bland for our palate. But we still enjoyed the experience

"March 11, 2015",50,very nice,"El Gran Paraiso is a nice place, in the middle of Caminito with good food, live music, excellent stuff and great value for money. We had typical Argentinie meat but my friend who is vegetarian also found something tasty to eat."
"November 29, 2014",50,Great ambience and tasty food,Stopped for lunch and completely enjoyed the place. Great ambience with basic but very tasty food at a reasonable price. The two brothers who run the place are very friendly and the staff is equally helpful. A bit tricky to find but definitely worth the effort.
"July 10, 2014",40,Fantastic feed in La Boca,Had lunch here while walking around Caminito. The design and colour of this restaurant reflects the overall design of Caminito and fuels a great atmosphere. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was excellent. Make sure you go up to the viewing platform during your visit. Excellent photo opportunity down one if the lanes of Caminito.
"April 2, 2014",50,Don't Miss this Hidden Gem off the main drag of La Boca,"We stumbled upon El Paraiso when walking around La Boca and clearly made the best choice possible. Extra friendly staff and owner/proprietor Bill. Our waiter was Eduardo and he was top notch. Grilled meats to order in super large quanities! We could not eat everything! But what we did eat was delicious. Excellent wine list and also excellent beer for the beer drinkers. During the lunch hour they had an excellent guitar player who had a wide range of songs for easy listening. Out of the way of the hustle and bustle that is La Boca. We ate there three consecutive days for lunch. Every day was better than the last. Great for families, couples and celebrations!"
"March 26, 2014",50,A gem in a touristy area...don't miss it!,"Walking the old railroad tracks, we were sucked in by the delicious smells of barbeque. It's a lovely courtyard, in which a guitar just seems right. Not overwhelming, but just right. Prices, service was all just great. Walk by all the touristy places and go around the back. Don't miss it."
"December 22, 2013",50,Amazing hidden gem of a restaurant in Boca,"How no one has reviewed this place I have no idea... It is amazing and I can't imagine there being a better place to eat, particularly for lunch in Boca. The restaurant is hidden away in a very large garden shaded by trees and umbrellas. Unlike all of the other tourist traps in the area, you are not ushered in at all or given the hard sell. It really did just seem to be full of locals and a few lucky tourists.  The food is pretty much all centered around a parilla (BBQ meat) or salads. The choripan was excellent.  Again, unlike the cheesy tourist tango shows on the street round the corner, there was a guitarist playing here for the diners who was absolutely fantastic. Not only was he an amazing guitarist and singer but he also gave a lot of history and detail all about the tango songs that he was playing. Nobody was actually dancing tango though. It was all explained in Spanish though.  Anyway, this is an incredible place to stop for lunch in Boca. I have no idea if it is open for dinner or not though. An absolute gem. Do not waste your time going anywhere else for lunch in Boca..."
"May 20, 2015",50,Delightful place!,Our city guide took us here during our visit of La Boca. We loved the ambience. Seating is outdoors. The meats are grilled right there at the entrance. Like the way the herbs and other things are placed as way of decor. There was also...More
"May 7, 2015",50,Wonderful emersion into the culture of Buenos Aires/La Boca/Argentina,"Arrive in Buenos Aires the first time in March 2015. Friend in the area suggested that we visit La Boca prior to my business trip really starting the next day. We walked the area, then arrived at El Gran Paraiso for dinner.  The courtyard dining was a wonderful treat. Not too hot or cold. We decided to dine family style and share all the dishes. I tried the blood sausage, chorizo, sirloin, etc. Everything was wonderful. It was fun to watch the grill and see all the cuts of meat being cooked. Most cuts come medium by default, if you want them more rare make sure to tell your server.  I would have been completely lost without my friends that translated. That day no one of the staff spoke English. I am so happy I went to experience the culture that is on display in La Boca."
"March 18, 2015",50,"Great food, people and atmosphere!","Luckily, we got a recommendation to come here from an artisan in La Boca, Buenos Aires. We, and our two friends needed a little break and a snack from walking around in the heat and selected a table on the lovely terrace in Gran Paraiso. Our waiter was smiling and friendly and tho we only had a snack of chorizo, empanadas and cold beer, it was a delightful little repast. Bill, one of the proprietors, engaged us in lively conversation and we felt totally at home. The food and beer were delicious, but even better was how at home we felt.

"August 8, 2013",50,Wow !!,"Should I list to what I compare this Parilla ? No, but pick the most popular among tourists and gente de BA and then eat here. Ojo de bife here 110 pesos, try Pobre Luis and pay 130 for half the quantity and 1/3 the quality. Lomo, as good as Peter Luger in NYC and 1/5 the price, I could go on to the Buddin De Pan which serves 4 well, and the wines which are priced well. Service is quick and professional as well as personal. Not the glitz of Mirasol, but clearly worth the taxi ride, and if you go, check out who is playing at Notorious just a few blocks away on Callo."
"May 28, 2013",50,Great Parrilla!,"An Argentine friend recommended this restaurant and I ate there five times in the space of a month. I tried a variety of the parrilla beef offerings and was not disappointed once.The chorizo was the best I had in my two-month stay in Argentina, and I chose that for my last dinner in Buenos Aires prior to flying home. It's an unpretentious place, brightly lit, with a great selection of wine and the best chimichurri I've ever had. I enjoy trying new food when I'm travelling, and the waiters were very helpful with suggestions. As others have commented, they also warned me when I was about to order too much food. Now that's service! It's clearly a ""local"" restaurant, as people were picking up take-out orders all the time and most of the customers embraced the waiters when they arrived and left. I liked the energy of the place very much and enjoyed being there. Highly recommended."
"May 7, 2013",50,"A fantastic food, and excellent service","We been there with my wife and ask for 2 different food, and the waiter said, stop, ask only one as they will reach for both, so we ordered ""Matambrito"" and was delicious, and we both eat well, a fantastic food, and great service. A place I will come back in the nearly future."
"April 16, 2013",40,Great lomito,"Great lomito: cooked to perfection in this down-to-earth restaurant without any fringes. We went on the recommendation of other readers, and were not disappointed.

"March 13, 2013",50,Down to earth with heavenly food,"We went with friends for lunch. Although the menue is partly in English we had a little problem to order. The waiter was honest enough to tell us not to order too much because we would not be able to eat it all. We had bife de lomo and tenderloin, a very nice crunchy garden salad, home made fries, fresh bread and the best chimichurri ever. The beef was excellent and the bottle of house wine went well with the meal. We were the only tourists in the restaurant but it was full with local folks. The service was fast and friendly and the price outstanding. We paid about $ 75 for this meal for 4 and took one steak home with us."

"March 29, 2012",40,this is the place i envision when someone tells me about old school buenos aires,"the waiters all wear coats, the meat is cooked out in the open, right at the front door, the menu is simple and the wine is everywhere. A good value as well."
"November 24, 2009",40,Excellent Parrilla in Central BA,"Parrilla Pena had some of the finest steaks that I eat whilst in BA. The decor of the restuarant was simple and the service not the most attentive, but the food (Bife de Chorizo, salad and empanada) were suberp."

We had the ribs, ojo de bife and bife de chorizo - all delcious. Portions are big so we shared a steak between us.  Highly recommend this parilla - the food is better than the parillas we ate in in Palermo. Go and you will not be disappointed. Just remember it is a clean but no frills place."
"August 25, 2011",50,"One of the best parrillas in Baires, period","Went for a nice dinner twice last week and they still have one of the best bife de lomo in BA.

As long as I keep visiting BA, I will be there."
"August 21, 2011",40,Not about ambiance but all about delicious fist-size empanadas and perfectly grilled meat.,"The parrilla is no means like the nicely decorated parrillas in san telmo or palermo, it is small and simple, a grill when walking in, and quick friendly service. Complimentary empanadas when walking in and generous portions of meat; the food is affordable and the quality is superb. A great place for meat-lovers and friends who doesn't care much about ambiance."
"March 10, 2011",30,Superb meat - service fair,"Yes, the food is great. Ordered an ""Ojo de bife con pure"" (Ribeye with mashed potatoes), which serves two. Cooked to perfection, period. And that's it. This is not a tourist restaurant. No credit cards accepted (good thing I asked and good thing they accepted dollar bills). Spanish only. The same ice machine is used to serve drinks and to chill wine bottles. Gross."
"June 3, 2010",50,We were the ONLY tourists at this restaurant,My husband has been in BA for the last three weeks and has tried out all the well known parrillas.

Great empanadas, creative salads all of high quality, the beef was some of the best we had in BA, empanadas were crispy and excellent and the papas provencal were also some of the best we had in the city. Large, decadent desserts. We were able to get in and out in under an hour, since we were pressed for time. While the restaurant is obviously on the tourist map, the Sunday we were there we heard no other English spoken. The restaurant was filled with what was obviously families of well heeled Portenos who likely have been dining there for years. It is still, in our opinion, one of the top spots for a parillada meal in BA. Not as hip as many newer spots but the food and service can't much be beaten."
"March 28, 2010",40,Best Chimichuri Sauce in BsAs!,"I love this restaurant! The service is good (although it will still take at least 2 hours for the whole meal as the locals certainly don't believe in rushing through dinner) and the food is good. I came once several years ago and I have been dreaming of coming back since. I finally made it back to Buenos Aires and insisted on taking my co-workers there. They all enjoyed it and I was in heaven! They have the BEST chimichuri sauce to accompany the steak. Plus they made us some fresh spicy salsa criolla too. I would definitely recommend Mirasol, particularly the one in Recova!"
"May 28, 2009",30,Not worth the hype,"Marisol is just okay! Sorry. I have eaten at 5 different parillas while I was here. Most Americans would probably like La Cabrera and my favorite (gluttony buffet of meat plus salad bar) Sige La Vaca in Puerto Madera. I paid $100 for 2 in El Marisol and only $60 la cabrera and $40 at Sige, all with drinks, 2 entrees, desserts, coffee. So, El Marisol is expensive, small portions (although I dont need a lot, I still like to see value for my bucks). Anyway, go somewhere else."

"November 8, 2010",40,"Good location, average average service & great steaks","This affordable restaurant in Buenos Aires offers all the best Argentinean cuts like, Entraña, Vacio, Ojo de Bife, and others. For lunch or dinner, reservation is highly recommended. I went to El Mirasol at list ten times in the last years, always enjoying it."
"July 18, 2010",50,Go to this restaurant!,"As a rule, we like to go to restaurants that are full of locals. We went to El Mirasol later in the evening, as is the custom, and had a fantastic experience. Food was great and the service impeccable. If you want an authentic Argentine dining experience, this is the place to go."
"June 27, 2010",50,Espectacular MEAT experience. All argentinean meat,"One of the MUST GO restaurants for Parrilla Argentina. Third time I go to this restaurant and always is top rated. There is another Mirasol in Puerto Madero, also great service and food. Must go"
"April 9, 2010",50,One of the best in BA,"We had a late Sunday lunch at El Mirasol recently. It was outstanding. Classic service, attentive and informed. The room is bright, the menu large and everything we ordered was excellent. As noted, some of the best chimichurri in BA. Great empanadas, creative salads all of high quality, the beef was some of the best we had in BA, empanadas were crispy and excellent and the papas provencal were also some of the best we had in the city.
