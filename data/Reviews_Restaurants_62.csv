"February 16, 2016",40,Small and friendly,"Called into Trieste first evening in Rome whilst out stretching our legs after the flight etc. We wanted something light to eat and this is just the place with it's tea plate size pizzas and friendly service. One patate e oliva pizza and one peperoni (peppers, not Americanised sausage) pizza were both tasty and just enough size wise. The man who served us said he was out of ""cheap"" wine and was good enough not to push a E25 bottle upon us, instead offering two varied Italian beers which were both enjoyable. This is not a sit down trattoria but there are bar stools at the counters set around this small, friendly shop. If you want a snack with welcoming staff call in here at Trieste."
"February 6, 2016",50,They deliver!,"After a long day of walking, and walking, and walking, I returned to my hotel unable to even contemplate going back out for dinner. Trieste Pizza to the rescue! The front desk placed the order for me, and 15 minutes later I was in pizza heaven.  Real Italian pizza is nothing like what passes for pizza in North America. I revelled in the wafer thin, crisp crust topped with steamed potato and olives, and the second pizza bianco with just mozzarella cheese. Heaven!"
"February 27, 2016",50,Great little pizza place,"We came across Trieste Pizza while wandering around the Cavour area looking for somewhere to eat. Hesitant at first (not being entirely sure about the small pizzas and large menu), the staff were very friendly and explained that they have a number of cooked pizzas which we could have straight away, or that they can cook to order. Being vegetarians it was nice to see vegetarian and vegan options plentiful and well denoted on the menu. We opted for a bit of both along with some beer and sat to eat in the small eating area. The pizzas were great, 'artisan' beer was nice, and we generally had a good evening; highly recommended!"
