"March 28, 2015",50,Superb pizza - take-away only,"We braved freezing weather in Paris to head over to this take-out only pizza place located in the 12th arrondissement. It was the discovery of the year!  You walk into the sliver of a store, which has about 4 bar stools and a small counter for eating in, and what immediately catches your eyes are all the awards and certificates stuck on the walls, which attest to the professionalism and skill of the masterful pizzaiolo Mr. G√©rard Giovanni.  Their pizzas are just divine. We went back 2 more times this week. That's how wonderful their pizzas are. So far, we've tried the Pizza Championne (it's a work of art: had red and yellow cherry tomato slices, rocket, pine nuts and other goodies on it), Pizza Julia (wonderfully grilled eggplant), Pizza Paysanne and Pizza Quatre saisons.  All their ingredients are fresh as hell. Also, their prices are not at all expensive for Paris. Where else can you get a delicious pizza with fresh ingredients, a perfect crust and friendly and fast service for between ‚Ç¨8.50 and ‚Ç¨12? Plus, they offered us a drink with every pizza. That's service!  We've eaten lots of pizza in Italy (of course) and all over the world. Seriously, Pizza Julia will rock your world!"
