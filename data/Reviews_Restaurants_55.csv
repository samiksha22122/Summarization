"June 23, 2017",50,Delicious Lamb And Excellent Service,"You will not regret eating here. Great service, even better food. Nice and cosy and a traditional restaurant where things are what they are. I have eaten here on many a special occasion and each time it has been excellent. Book in advance to avoid disappointment and you won't regret making your way down to El Molinero"
"December 13, 2015",40,Great place to go to after the Zoo or Parque de Atracciones,"We spent the day at the Zoo, and as always wanted to avoid the fast food garbage food they usually serve in these places. We found Meson Molinero with the help of tripadvisor and it was a great surprise. It is the kind of place you would never stop by if it was not for a recommendation. Typical Spanish asador with great food and fantastic service. Average price of about 40-45 eur/person which is a bit high for the neighbourhood but good value for money considering quality and service you get. I can really recommend it."
