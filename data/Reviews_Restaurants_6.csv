"December 29, 2018",50,Relaxing setting with Excellent food!,"We were visiting NYC after Christmas and went to Keens for Lunch. 6 of us were dining and at least 3 of us had the Prime Fillet - 2 with the Mushrooms sauce which was phenomenal, and 1 with Au Poivre which good. I have been to many of the best steakhouses in the world, and this was not the best I have ever had, but it was pretty excellent. My daughter had the Arctic Char and really enjoyed that and a couple of us had the Lobster Salad which was also great.  I think everyone was happy with everything - they had some good looking desserts, but we were too stuffed. The main dining area with all the pipes hanging on the ceiling was very relaxing and provided a great atmosphere for dining."
"December 29, 2018",50,Best steak we’ve ever had!,We went here for my dads birthday in December - booked online a couple of months in advance to make sure we got a table and the place was packed. The lobster bisque was delicious and we shared a porterhouse steak between 3 - it was huge! We may have got away with a porterhouse for 2 between the 3 of us but it depends on appetites. They put a candle in my dads creme brûlée which was a nice touch as I mentioned on booking it was his birthday. Definitely a must visit for steak lovers!
"December 28, 2018",40,Best steak!,"We pre-booked a table here on a Tuesday evening, popped our coats in the hold and were immediately seen to our table- a booth right at the back of the restaurant.  The staff were really helpful in explaining the menu and recommending dishes and wine! We ordered Porterhouse steak with creamed spinach and garlic mushrooms- it was amazing! It is impressive in presentation and so flavoursome! It was a little salty however the menu did note they do salt quite a bit and that you could request less on ordering. The food was more than enough for us!!  We visited for a special birthday, which I had let them know on booking the table and without knowing, they brought a key lime pie out with a candle in at the end of our meal which was a lovely touch and much appreciated!  Atmosphere was nice- lighting was low and restaurant is cosey. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves!  Clearly a very popular, well established steak house- really glad we visited and would recommend for a special occasion!"

"December 26, 2018",30,Meh,"Came in with a group late after a game at MSG and were very underwhelmed. The ""classic mutton chop"" (asserted to be a specialty) was tasteless, full of fat and very difficult to cut/eat. The steak and shrimp cocktail were just ok (we much preferred Luger's). The service was borderline hostile -- I guess we weren't drinking enough or maybe the staff just wanted to go home (even though we came in an hour before nominal closing). The old-New York setting was nice."

Steak and lobster were perfectly cooked!! When I’m visiting New York again I will definitely be back!!"
"December 20, 2018",20,Food Ok. Service lacking. No Passes to Ricks,"The food was good for what you pay but not on par for the price and nowhere near the elite in the area such as DelFriscos, Capital Grille, Quality Meats, Wolfgang’s or Mastros. Not worth 4 Star Prices for old decor. Service was ok left table uncleared for 20 minutes. Cherry on top was the Manager telling us that they don’t have complementary passes to Ricks because ownerships does not agree with the message. Will never eat here again or recommend to anyone based on the answer we got about the passes to Ricks"
"December 19, 2018",50,Excellent steak,"Excellent steak, bread and atmosphere. What else do you need to know? Trip advisor won’t let me stop at that, so here goes. There are thousands of clay pipes on the ceilings. The restaurant has been around since the 1800s. Very interesting. The room we were first sat in upstairs was ruined by one amazingly obnoxious and loud woman. The restaurant was kind enough to move us down to the main dining room where it was quiet and perfect. The steak was amazingly good and cooked to perfection. We will definitely return."

"January 22, 2017",40,"Nice atmosphere, check out the ceramic pipe collection","We went there for late dinner after a Rangers game and was seated promptly in the bar area.

"November 30, 2016",30,Ambience better than the food,"Selected this restaurant based on reviews and its history. Although food and service was good, I expected better. Limited selection of steaks. My steak was slightly overcooked and the seafood salad would have been better with less dressing."

"November 4, 2016",50,"Mutton mutton, who's got the mutton?","Go for the muttonchops. And since you're already there, add some carbs (creamy mashed potatoes) and fatty vegetables (creamed spinach). And top it all off with some mushrooms to boot. Worth the hype. Beautiful old-school ambiance. Always a pleasure."
"November 1, 2016",30,Date night,Nothing to write home about. Staff was not very helpful and super slow. Restaurant was very stuffy. Uncomfortably warm with outside temps in the mid 40s. Steak was good but not very flavorful. $245 meal for two I expected to be blown away.
"October 30, 2016",50,Excellent classic steak dinner,Great service - very efficient but not rushed. Enjoyed the artichoke then shared the porterhouse for 2 (among 3) which was delicious and well seasoned. Not a cheap meal but worth every cent.

"October 22, 2016",30,Too loud,"An OK meal, but not for the price. Lobster Bisque was good, but had pieces of crab meat in it, not lobster. $20 for the roasted vegetables."
"October 20, 2016",50,Great steak and service,"Great steak, great wine suggestion, great service and interesting place with lot of history. More expensive than mid-range, but not too pricy and absolute worth it."

"October 17, 2016",50,Best Food and Ambience Ever,"The history of the pipes makes this historic restaurant a place to see despite having dinner. However, the steaks are to die for and the cocktails are perfect! I've eaten at restaurants all over and this is definitely one of my top ten!"
"October 17, 2016",40,Great dinner in the Bull Moose Room,"Had a wonderful opportunity to have a business dinner with eighteen colleagues. The staff and service were top notch and the food and wine was superb. Keens really does live up to it's reputation. Oh, and the old pipes are all very cool."
"October 16, 2016",50,Dining experence,The story the history the character of the restaurant is enough to go there not to say enough about the quality of the food. We had a very delicious filet and lobster that we are still talking about.
"October 15, 2016",50,Fantastic meal,Last night in New York and came here for dinner. We both had the fillet mignon with lobster and it was excellent. Great atmosphere with staff to match.
"October 14, 2016",50,What a fabulous dinner,"The place is very historic. The food was outstanding and the service matched. The steaks, mutton chop and prime rib all made for a meal to remember. Save room for desert, which was equally impressive."
"October 13, 2016",30,Had a way better steak in TX for half the price,"The atmosphere is very unique and cool, along with a very friendly waitstaff. However, my steak was not up to pair with any steak place in TX. Was not worth the price at all."
"October 11, 2016",50,Top steak house,"Great atmosphere and decor, with the thousands of pipes. Very good food and excellent service. It's not for no reason that Keens has been around for a very long time."

"September 28, 2016",50,Classic and awesome!,This is an old school steakhouse - the kind that make you wish you had dined here a century ago when it was state of the art so that you could have a better appreciation of the history of the place. Great food and service!
"September 25, 2016",50,Best Steaks Ever,My hubby and I have just enjoyed a gorgeous steak dinner in Keens. It was cooked to perfection and extremely tasty. Friendly and great atmosphere. Worth every penny to have a steak of this quality.
"September 24, 2016",40,Seriously good steak,Top notch steakhouse. Excellent cuts of beef prepared just as ordered. We were massively overdressed. Weird since dinner for two can easily exceed $300.

"September 20, 2016",40,The biggest steak you will ever see or eat in your life,"In summary, Keens is a must for anyone willing to fork out for the steak of their life, in a historic, quaint chop house which has an old-worldly feel to it."

"September 14, 2016",20,High price for average food.,My wife and I were jammed into a table between two tables with 4 people on each side. Only exit was between our table and theirs. Spent 176.00 and while the portion was large the flavor was below average.
"September 13, 2016",50,Awesome food and atmosphere.,"One of the best steak dinners we've had anywhere. A tremendous restaurant experience all around, from the smoking pipe decor to every bit of food and drink we tried. Be advised - it's not cheap. But no great steak meal ever is."

"August 13, 2016",50,One of The Best,"This is yet another institution in The City. For some reason I prefer the chops here, but not because the steaks aren't just as scrumptious. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose at this place."
"August 9, 2016",50,"One of the top steak houses in NYC - great food, wine list and charming setting",It doesn't get much better than Keens. Porterhouse is fantastic. Mutton chops are very unique. Thick cut bacon is incredible. This is an old school steakhouse at its best.

"July 15, 2016",30,Nice steak,Very nice steak with a good Caesar salad. Good atmosphere with good music but a little expensive for this type of food: steak and salad. There are other options that I did not prove and seems to be very good.
"July 9, 2016",50,Super Steakhouse,"The porterhouse for 2 was huge, we also ordered lobster which was also huge. All perfectly cooked and quality meat and fish. Service was excellent - professional and helpful. Hard to get into but worth it if you get a slot."

"July 1, 2016",50,Mutton Mutton Mutton,I've eaten at all the great NY Steakhouses many times. However none have anything quite like a Keens Mutton Chop. Worth it a few times a year to satifiy that lamb craving.
"June 28, 2016",50,One of my favorite Steak House's in the City,"One the best steaks in the city. Love sitting at the bar or in the upstair dinning rooms. Their fresh ginger ale is the best... sometime it's not on the menu, so ask."

"June 27, 2016",30,Slow service- food good,For someplace as expensive as keeps you expect them to get it right. Service was slow- I was hoping for more. Several mistakes I don't think there staff were all on the same page.

"June 22, 2016",50,The best steaks I ever had!,"So it's pretty simple, you need to order the Mutton chops and the Porterhous. Don't come alone and make sure you try both cuts!! Big cuts, no real need for side dishes etc... The best steakhouse in NYC for sure! Enjoy, E."

"July 14, 2014",50,The Right Choice,"I did a lot of research in choosing what steakhouse I would go to in NYC, and Keens was definitely the right choice. The thick cut bacon was a great starter and the steak was unbelievebly tender. Everything is pricey but well worth the money."

"June 28, 2014",40,Good steak and good service,Received a lovely welcome when we visited and were offered a drink at the bar first before going upstairs to the restaurant. The bar area also had seating for food which looked a bit like a pub atmosphere which was nice.  The upstairs areas were huge with many people dining therfore glad we booked in advance. We were seated at a small table for two near the door and were offered the menu pretty quickly. The waiter was lovely and really chatty. There was no rush to order which was nice. The menu looked great however as we were having steak we were not looking to have additional courses.  The fillet mignon was beautiful and cooked exactly how we wanted it. Served with fries on the side it was filling but we couldn't resist a pud to share. The chocolate mousse with 2 spoons finished off the meal brilliantly!  Would definitely recommend for both the food and the atmosphere.

"June 25, 2014",50,Worth every penny!,"My daughter and son-in-law recently hosted a graduation luncheon at Keen's in May. Wow, what a great experience it was! Our server, Will, was so attentive without ever interrupting the celebration. He went out of this way to see that everyone's needs were well taken care of. To say the least, the service is outstanding. We had very high expectations when it came to the food. We were not disappointed, in fact, it was so much better than we expected. The steaks were amazing and everyone commented on how delicious their meal was. It is a must if you are looking for excellent food and service in NYC. The restaurant décor is historic and everything you expect from a high end steakhouse. Highly recommend."
"June 25, 2014",50,AMAZING,"Best steak we've ever had, and the entire atmosphere was beyond amazing. Worth every penny. We had the carrot cake for dessert, and this is without a doubt the best cake i have had in my life, and i love cakes. I truly recommend this place to anyone who appreciates a good steak"
"June 23, 2014",50,Simply the best,"Awesome steaks, spectacular service. I'm from Chicago, which has about a dozen of the world’s finest steakhouses clustered together around Michigan Avenue. It makes you a bit jaded because perfect is sort of the norm. I ate at Gallager’s last time I was in NYC, and it was okay but not great.  Keens was spectacular. The steak was cooked perfectly — char crust on top, perfect temperature, wonderful cut of meat. The restaurant dates back to the 1880’s and when I asked about it the waiter took the time to answer my questions. He also asked me about the playbill on my table, as he did with the couple next to us, which led to a really interesting conversation about the shows, which he maintained while NEVER NEGLECTING HIS TABLES. Wow — great venue, great waiter, perfect steak.  I'd love to move Keens to Chicago, which is the highest compliment I can pay any steakhouse."
"June 23, 2014",50,Steaks on Steaks,"I eat at Keens any time I am going to the Garden for a game. This has an old mobster type feel, which I like. The food is unbeatable in the lower part of Midtown (weird area) and I actually like Keens more than lugars or Smith and Wollensky. Go Porterhouse/Ribeye and get some mashed potatoes and a good salad. It might set you back 100 USD but its worth it"
"June 23, 2014",50,Great food and service.,The level of service and attention I received was outstanding. I ordered a bone in ribeye with creamed spinach and it was excellent. The wine selection was substantial as well. Overall it was an experience I recommend.
"June 23, 2014",50,A New York Steakhouse with style,"We ate as a family at Keens in late May: as ever, it did not disappoint. Unashamedly old style, Keens offers a comfortable welcome, stylish and slightly unusual surroundings, and first rate steaks. Two of the party had their T bone steak - very nicely done, but larger than most visitors from Europe might expect! The filet mignons were excellent, and the prices on the substantial wine list were not too startling for Midtown NYC. The atmosphere tends to be lively, and the service is attentive without being overbearing, both of which makes an important contribution to an enjoyable experience. Having tried some of the competition over the years, this remains the place we would recommend to fellow visitors to New York on the grounds of its reliable all round quality. Quite a lot of people seem to share that view: booking is essential!"
"June 20, 2014",50,2nd visit better than the first.,We came back for our 4th anniversary meal and was not disappointed. I had the 8oz fillet mignon and the husband went for The Legendary Mutton Chop. Both melted like butter in your mouth. Definitely recommend this steakhouse/chophouse.
"June 20, 2014",30,Okay but had better,Okay if you like salt. Food way over seasoned. Very busy so need to book in advance - can't help but notice the best reviews come from USA. Morton's Steak House far superior. Would not recommend a visit to Keens.
"June 17, 2014",50,Great Mutton chops and martinis!,"Our first time here, started at the bar with martinis and then dinner. Love the ambiance, friendly service and fantastic food. It was a busy night but service was excellent, not hurried at all. Would love to come back here next time we're in NY."
"June 17, 2014",40,Great...Salad & Burgers,"Excellent Caesar salad for those who need to continue their day after spending some time in this quiet, wood-paneled New York standard. Cheeseburgers are available (off-menu) and are superb. Eat in the bar area and soak up the history. Great Midtown location."
"June 12, 2014",50,Will Return,Keens did not disappoint in any way. Great table service well priced wine and really excellent steak. Totally unrushed very clean and we could hear ourselves speak across the table unlike some venues in New York. High quality dinning at a reasonable price. Must Book.

"May 16, 2014",50,Amazing prime rib,"The place is very traditional with great service. It is not cheap, but worth the money. The prime rib is an experience and their whiskey / bourbon is outstanding."
"May 11, 2014",50,Fabulous steak in a historical setting,Keens steakhouse is set in a historical setting with the clay pipes of many historical figures. Teddy Roosevelt held meetings there when he was police commissioner of NYC. And the food is fabulous! You will not be disappointed with a meal there.
"May 10, 2014",50,Couldn't get a better steak anywhere,We came last year and will definitely be back when we return in 4 weeks. I had the fillet steak and the husband got the ribeye. They were really big so filled you to the brim. The pipe collection is fantastic.

"December 8, 2013",50,"Delicious food, great service, cool place","I love the food here. It is a great steakhouse! The decor is cool....covered in pipes... (see my pix). Unlike some other big name steakhouses the staff is friendly, and the whole place has a warm feeling."
"November 30, 2013",50,Porterhouse!,"Great Steakhouse. Unique ambience, exceptional service, great food. Ok it isn't cheap but great things seldom are."

"November 29, 2013",30,Pretty average place,"Over the last couple of years, I have had the opportunity to eat at many steakhouses around the country. Some that are chains and some that are locally owned. One thing they all have had in common is a very high level of service. All...More"
"November 27, 2013",40,Great restaurant if you love steak!!!,A very interesting restaurant and very different from other eating places in New York. A great atmosphere and very unusual layout with lots of different rooms to eat in. The steaks are massive even by New York standards and the service was very good. Would defiantly go there again when visiting NYC.
"November 25, 2013",50,Never disappoints,Second time in NYC and second time eating here - just as good as I remember.  Love the decor and atmosphere. Good service quite friendly staff. Layout of the restaurant is interesting and adds to the feel.  Really good steak but also does other food if you not a complete steak fan. Great pace for either couples or groups. Will eat there again when visiting NYC.
"November 23, 2013",30,New York Proves Again that 5 stars is Average,"Not from NY, but I have traveled the world and dont find anything spectacular about this place. Maybe my expecations were too high, but we did the Porterhouse for 2, the bacon app, and a desert. Was it good, yes. Great, no. Ambieance was above average, but I wouldnt go back."
"November 22, 2013",50,One of a kind experience,"This was absolutely fantastic. Keen's is truly a gem in NYC. Built in 1885, it's maintained its old world charm. It is amazing to see all of the churchwarden pipes that line the ceiling, as well as the ones in glass in the front lobby that belonged to the likes of Babe Ruth, JFK, Buffalo Bill, Michael Jackson, etc. It's just amazing to see that kind of history in the US.  History and decor aside, the food was also outstanding. This is definitely not your everyday meal, it's a bit pricey, but well worth it. Plus, they have a scotch list that has over 275 scotches, pretty impressive.  Definitely a must see for any visitor to the NYC area."
"November 22, 2013",50,A great taste of old New York,"We loved this restaurant!! The food was excellent, but what made it so special for us was the atmosphere. The sense of history at Keen's is amazing! It truly sets it apart from any other steakhouse that we've been to. Keen's is a must go in NYC !!!!"
"November 21, 2013",40,Unique New York!,"The décor in this place is awesome! Hundreds and thousands of pipes hang from the ceiling with every inch of the walls filled with pictures giving it a unique vibe.  Whilst i don't have anything negative to say about the service or staff, i didn't get the same friendly vibe as i did from other restaurants we visited on our trip. If the service had been outstanding i would have given this place 5 stars.  The food was perfect, steaks cooked to perfection, over generous sizes for the main course and also the sides - being Brits we are used to much smaller portion sizes and opted for two sides to share between two - we barely ate any of either!"
"November 20, 2013",50,Fantastic!,"The steak was delicious! Loved the grilled red peppers with it. I suggest making a reservation. We did not, but they helped us find a seat at the bar and we ate there. Bartender was exceptional as a waiter. I can see why Keens is still in business since the 1800's. The food was delightful."
"November 20, 2013",50,wild mushroom sauce! house bleu cheese n wedge!,"I called ahead just to make sure they'd tolerate my fam n me in shorts n sandals, b/c it sounded like a nice place from the reviews. The gent on the phone was gracious and welcomed me to come, indicating he'd hold a table for me. The place is old in all the best ways--literally older than KS, as are a lot of things in a city older than our country. Real estate is tight, but comfortable. The steaks rock, grilled asparagus, baked potato, WILD MUSHROOM SAUCE! Creme brûlée wa a delight. Count on dropping some ca$h (like Ruth Criss, is all), but it's sooo worth it. You will compare all other steak houses to this fond memory."
"November 20, 2013",40,Always a great place to go,"Amazing place for any meat lovers! If you can be seated in the Lambs Room, it is an experience in itself! The service has always been very good and I do recommend the burger or the porterhouse to share.. Will definitely be back"
"November 13, 2013",50,best fillet i ever had,it s expensive restaurant but worth every dollar i had a fillet 12 oz with creamy mash medium to well the fillet is very tender and juicy and had one coca cola and paid about 70$ one of the best restaurant in new York
"November 7, 2013",50,Superb meal,"Can't rater this place any higher if you are a steak lover, food brilliant, first class service, great ambiance"
"November 5, 2013",40,"Excellent. Great food and staff, worth the price",Delicious lobster bisque and steaks. Beautiful restaurant. Quite expensive but worth it. Highly recommended. Great atmosphere in the bar too with a good choice of wines and whisky.
"November 5, 2013",30,Good place for drinks,Met a friend for a drink there. With only 1 bartender tending a large and full bar made getting a drink a bit challenging but great atmosphere and good vibe.
"November 4, 2013",50,Excellent Meet Place,"A friend recommended the Keens as one of the best steak places in NYC and he was right. The Sirloin was absolutely fantastic, grilled to the point and big enough to feed a man like me. Service was also very professional. Overall worth the price."
"November 1, 2013",40,Very good steaks,"While visiting NY i wanted to try a steak in this city. I took filet and it was very good, but ... i have had better."
"October 27, 2013",50,Hidden Gem,"This is a quintessential steakhouse right in the middle of Midtown Manhattan. They have the best Scotch list that I've ever seen. Thank the bartender for recommending Glenfarclas 21, a single malt that is to dye for!"
"October 26, 2013",50,"Historic, Great Steak","Excellent scotch selection, steaks were perfectly cooked, desserts were great. Only negative was the seating -- much too tightly packed. Otherwise, an excellent evening."
"October 23, 2013",40,OMG!! The steaks are HUGE!!,"Please, please ask the waiter for advice!! My husband was served half a cow lol! Seriously, these steaks are whoppers but worth every cent!"
"October 22, 2013",40,Friendly steakhouse,Highly recommend if you are in the area. Very popular and hard to get into but well worth the wait. Enjoyed the Filet Mignon which was cooked to perfection.
"October 22, 2013",50,Mouton Mania,"The best mouton chop you will ever taste. Wonderful sides. Attentive service. Plus, don't forget to try their homemade ginger ale."
"October 21, 2013",50,One of the best in the city,"Keen's Steakhouse is one of the best restaurants in the city. The steak there is exceptional, and service is outstanding."
"October 18, 2013",50,Great steak and fab atmosphere,One of the best steaks we have ever had. Really great food and superb atmosphere and history. There were a lot of locals in the restaurant so obviously a favourite with everyone and we will definitely be going back
"October 15, 2013",50,One of the best if not the best steakhouse in New York,"Nice and different decor, excellent food and service, and a really good atmosphere. I prefer it to Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille for instance."
"October 15, 2013",50,Best Steakhouse,This is the restaurant to visit if you want a good steak. Would recommend the Porterhouse for two - melt in your mouth. Very attentive staff - the highlight of our visit to New York.
"October 14, 2013",50,Mutton chop lives up to it's glory,The mutton chop is a must try. It was one of the best I've had. There was a good balance between the amount fat and meat. Well worth the return trip and price.
"October 12, 2013",50,great food and great vibe,"Keen's serves great steaks in an ever greater setting. The restaurant has a unique ""old city"" look and feel. Loved having a great steak here. Definitely try the legendary mutton chop!"
"October 10, 2013",50,Porterhouse heaven,"Location in Manhattan was great, best porterhouse we've tasted. Very classic old school steakhouse, worth the price for a special occasion. The hash browns were only available for dinner and they were great!"
"October 10, 2013",50,Great steak dinner,"Really enjoyed the porterhouse dinner, nice ambiance was recommended to eat here. A little $$$$ but very very good service and dining experience"
"October 8, 2013",50,Big steaks and great service !!!,Have been here before and again the staff delivered excellent service. I had the King cut rib-eye and some had the salmon and one went with the lobster. The food and wine are of top quality and of course the price follows.
"October 5, 2013",50,Great steak in the heart of midtown.,Great steaks in traditional surroundings. Impeccable service. Meat cooked to perfection. A definite place to visit. Put it on your list.
"October 5, 2013",30,Very mixed experienced - awesome food but most arrogant waiter ever!,"Had a great steak here after a loooong wait, very arrogant waiter who I think was just used to too much tips for doing nothing. The atmosphere cool with ceiling beautifully decorated, at least then you something to do while you wait."
"October 5, 2013",50,What a Steak....!,Absolutely to die for. Strongly recommend the Prime rib. Book ahead if possible and ask for the prime rib to be held for you to avoid disappointment
"October 4, 2013",50,Keens rules!,"Antique feeling while still feeling clean. Just the perfect Manhattan experience, with the little European-sized tables close to each other, there was good wine, very attentive wait staff, everything was delicious, this is why I live, for happy moments like this."
"October 1, 2013",50,Just great!,"If you are looking for one of the best steaks in town in a very special, cozy ambiance with great service - go to Keen's. Our party of four had the Porterhouse steak for three and the buttermilk chicken and everything was simply awesome!"
"September 30, 2013",50,A wonderful steak restaurant,My wife and I went to Keen's on Sept 28 and really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. We had steaks cooked to perfection and the Oysters Rockefeller was excellent! The service was so-so but the food made up for it.
"September 23, 2013",40,Great Place for a Steak,"If you are watch Broadwalk Empire, even Nucky wanted to come here for some chops. Great food and the service was superb. We had some issues with our meal, but the problem was solved immediately."
"September 14, 2013",30,"interesting history, good food",Old steak house with an interesting history. Prices are high and in line with what you would pay at other high end steak houses. Service and food were good but not outstanding for this caliber of restaurant.
"September 11, 2013",50,Excellent old school steak house in midtown,Service was excellent. Make sure you inquire about the pipes on the ceiling. Filet was cooked perfectly and tasty. Wedge salad had an excellent blue cheese dressing. Cream spinach was very good as a side. Was there for a business meeting.
"September 9, 2013",20,Not worth the bucks!,The food was decidedly average and the sides are extortionate at circa $10 for a small plate of mushrooms or fries. The a/c was also problematic as the top floor of the restaurant was freezing. I won't be back.
"September 5, 2013",50,Outstanding!,"Every time we go to NYC, Keen's is must! Best food, best service, best ambiance. The menu has nice variety and have never been disappointed. The surroundings have a great level of historical interest as well."
"September 5, 2013",50,If you want steak this is the place,Excellent steak; old house steak atmosphere and quick service; overall an excellent choice close to Times Square
"September 6, 2013",50,Difficult to beat,Previous reviews have said it all . This restaurant serves excellent steaks with attentive service in unusual surroundings with many pipes!

"September 5, 2013",50,Outstanding!,"Every time we go to NYC, Keen's is must! Best food, best service, best ambiance. The menu has nice variety and have never been disappointed. The surroundings have a great level of historical interest as well."
"September 5, 2013",50,Best steak in NYC,"We dined at Keens with friends last week. Divine! We'd eaten there before but took more time to enjoy it this time.  The service is outstanding, the atmosphere lovely and the food - simply divine.  Highly recommended for a special night out when you're visiting NYC."
"September 5, 2013",50,Amazing,"This is te best steak I've ever had. I can't remember other steaks but this one I definitely will. You need to order the sides as extra but others just had steaks on their own they were that huge. Staff very friendly. Relaxed atmosphere even though it was very busy and we went on a Monday. If you go to New York, you new to go here."
"September 5, 2013",50,If you want steak this is the place,Excellent steak; old house steak atmosphere and quick service; overall an excellent choice close to Times Square
"September 4, 2013",40,Great Food in a Historic Setting,We live outside the city and try to find places with excellent food when we visit. The steak was top notch and thought the Béarnaise sauce was the best ever had. We made reservations and had no problems. I thought due to the expensive prices that it would be a more formal setting with patrons but it was not. We did dress up a little bit but most others were dressed very casually and some even had young children in tow. The staff was attentive but not pushy. Portions were very good.
"September 4, 2013",40,Great steak--isn't that why you want to go?,"Family trip to NYC and after surveying the competitive and extensive steak landscape, we landed on Keens. Two older children, family. Place is old school, not stuffy and more casual than some of the white gloved places. Service was solid and unpretentious.  If you are looking for the super white gloved, italian suited manager in a restaurant that looks like the one at home--go to Del Frisco's. (a favorite at home) They are great but don't have the local character. Keen's 12oz filet might be the best filet that I have ever had and in somewhat less stuffy environment. It is expensive but on par with others and hey--a NYC steakhouse--what do you expect? Certainly no more expensive than the similar Capital Grille/Def Frisco's/Ruth's Cris options locally.  I gave it a 3 on kids. My kids are older so were just perfect but I would not want to see young children (<10) there."
"September 4, 2013",50,great steak,"I chose this restaurant because of location near hotel and Trip Advisor rating. The ambience and history are unbeatable. Of course most people were dressed in shorts and T-shirts so that I felt like we were at a themed restaurant at Disneyland. Service and food very good. I had small filet and Daughter and BF had porterhouse for 2. Both cuts tender and tasty. Toward the end of our meal a glass candle on our table "" exploded"". No injury but we were comped dessert which was nice. Will go again when in NY."
"September 4, 2013",40,Very good steak and interesting place,"When in New York we wanted to try a good quality steak, and Keens looked like it would fit the bill. We booked a table for 6 with no problems and upon arrival were seated immediately at a central table, a great spot that didn't at all feel overlooked on a busy night. Food-wise, the steak was great, cooked just as I asked and with plenty of flavour. The wine complimented it nicely and the service was above standard. The bill was pretty hefty but the food was worth it. The bit I really liked about this place was it's history and the story behind the thousands of clay pipes attached to the ceiling and the old pictures on the walls. It gave it a real sense of identity especially with the more famous pipes of some very recognisable historical figures in a glass case by the front. All in a all a great experience."
"September 4, 2013",50,Worth searching out,"Keens is more than a steakhouse. The building and it's history add to the enjoyment. Food is good, service matches and you know you are enjoying it all in a place that is a little different to the current trend of smoked mirrors and brash colours - this is tradition at its best. Dinned at Keens on last visit to New York and enjoyed just as much this time."
"August 30, 2013",50,Steak!,"Huge pieces of steak! Order sides separately I shared an order with another from our party, and am glad that I did as the portions were large but really tasty."
"August 30, 2013",50,Great steakhouse,"Excellent service, very good food, great atmosphere, nice wine, place to stay and have a ""relax"" lunch in a crazy city as NY Ps: Creme Bruleè was outstanding"
"August 29, 2013",50,steak at its best.,Old world charm with great ambience. The restaurant was busy but not too noisy. Our chateaubriand for two was to die for a nd the accompanying sauces mouth watering. Service was good and extensive wine list made for a great night.
"August 27, 2013",50,Excellent All Around,"The steaks were great. Cooked perfectly, very tender and flavourful. Drinks were good, dessert was amazing and service was impecable. All the staff were very friendly and made this birthday celebration one to remember. Would love to fo back."
"August 24, 2013",30,Stuffy atmosphere,Very 'stuffy' atmosphere! Not very welcoming! Took my daughter to this restaurant for a birthday lunch. Restaurant was a random choice.
"August 21, 2013",50,Historic restaurant with amazing steak and lunch salads,"Ceiling hosts historic coillection of men's smioking pipes, including Clevenand's and TR's. Steaks are greeat, but first time we tried entree salads for lunch. They are spectacular. Great meat, shrimp, chicken and veggie combos."
"August 20, 2013",50,WOW,A historic NYC chophouse. Excellent food served family style with amazing service. Good wine list. A great dining experience
"August 20, 2013",50,Best steak we had,"The service was great and the cocktails, salad, wine and of course the steaks (filet mignon) were amazingly good. Yes it is a little expensive but it was worth it. I highly recommend it."
"August 18, 2013",50,Perfection,"Amazing old Manhattan ambience, outstanding service and amazing food. A definitely must dine at while in New York. A New York institution. Handsome drinks, gorgeous steaks, impeccable service. 100% of the time... We always go back.."
"August 11, 2013",40,Heaven for meat lover,"Not a very family restaurant, but very impresive wine list and chop was very good, the best I ever had. You may want to start with the bacon, the fat may stop you heart, but the flavor is worth to dead for."
"August 5, 2013",40,Typical NY steakhouse.,"Reminded me of the Chicago Tavern Chop House, including 3 floors of dining. Noisy, colorful, extensive wines, prompt service, a good experience. The steaks were good not great. The balance of the meals were in the same category. Good experience."
"August 4, 2013",50,fantastic,"amazing food, service 1st class-my daughter needed some painkillers-and the head waiter came to the pharmacy with me to show me the way ! Atmosphere really good"
"August 2, 2013",50,One step out of NYC,One step into the tavern and it seem like you're some place else. The bar is medium size and full. It is attached to the restaurant and it has NYC history and character. http://www.keens.com
"July 30, 2013",40,Wow. Best steak ever.,"We spent serious bucks here, but it was well worth it. Loved the cocktails, the oysters, the steaks (a bit salty, but next time I'll request little salt). Nice friendly service. Not too keen on the specialty of the house- mutton chops-were over cooked."
"July 25, 2013",50,Best steak i've ever had,"this was easily one of the best steaks I've ever had. don't be scared off by the price, it's absolutely worth it. the sauces were devine"

"July 16, 2013",50,Excellent NYC Steakhouse,"I have dined at Keens several times; most recently for lunch. The atmosphere is very unique and the service is excellent. The food is also very good, but very pricey. I would recommend visiting on an expense account."
"July 3, 2013",50,Incredible food and friendly service,Love the old-school history and ambiance of this legendary but vital steak house. Everything was delicious (didn't love the lobster bisque though) and staff will do everything they can to satisfy
"June 26, 2013",50,Delicious steaks and sides,"Great atmosphere and amazing food. The meat was of great quality, perfectly cooked to order and the sides were amazing. Special mention for the creamed spinach"
"June 25, 2013",50,Great food even for a vegetarian,It was nice for a steakhouse to accommodate a vegetarian with a nice and tasty vegetable plate. The decor brings you back in time with a ceiling filled with old clay pipes.
"June 23, 2013",30,Great service- good food,We really enjoyed our night out at Keens. We had good food and excellent service. Personally for the money I would have preferred Del Friscos.
"June 23, 2013",50,Amazing,"Easily one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. The mutton chop was devine!!! Everything was stellar. Not cheap, but what price do you put on one of the best meals you'll ever have in a restaurant."
"June 21, 2013",40,Best steak ever - expensive but worth it,"Just round the corner from our hotel, this offered an expensive night out but the biggest steaks ever, perfectly cooked with a rugby sized baked potato. Best meal I had on this visit to the States. Would go again"
"June 20, 2013",50,Such history and ambience!,amazing little nooks and crannies - such a great A+ experience. Excellent service and delicious food!
"June 16, 2013",50,Good steaks in great ambiance,We came here for meat & our steaks were excellent. Portions are big so you'd better not to take starter in case you wanna go for desert. Filet mignon & new york steaks were very good! Take also cheese-cake!!!
"June 15, 2013",50,Love it,"Had a superb evening at keen's last night. 28oz of chateuabriand amazing but a lot, so make sure you are hungry! Atmosphere, service and food all top notch. Highly recommended."

"June 6, 2013",40,"Great experience, but a little dissapointed","I enjoyed a 12oz filet mignon, good steak, perfectly cooked, presentation was so so. Other people in the party had shared pieces, I would probably do that if I went back. All in all, great experience though and a cool atmosphere."
"June 6, 2013",50,Simply the best!,"Not too much to say about this. It was the best steak house I have ever been to - and I like my steak! Everything; food, drink, service and ambience is second to none for this type of dining experience."
"June 5, 2013",50,Keens Steakhouse New York,"Great Steakhouse. Great ambience. Great service. Yes, the bill will be high, but that is to be expected. We had 3 entrees and 2 appetizers and a side or two for 5 of us, with leftovers to take home. Would highly recommend this restaurant."

"May 25, 2013",50,"Calling all steak, mutton lovers","Food,service,wine list price all were terrific. Great value for a historic, high quality, NYC steakhouse and the only the only mutton chop we have tasted we liked. Filet melts in your mouth, banana foster desert just right. Price very reasonable for NYC historic restaurant choice"
"May 24, 2013",50,Awesome meal,We have eaten at some of the finest steakhouses and this rates right up at the top! I would highly recommend the prime rib or the tbone!
"May 24, 2013",40,Overpriced,"Good steak, but as good as in many others restaurans. I liked 3 things: special draft beer - excellent!, waiters and their servers were brilliant, and nice decorated rooms. The food was ordinary, small plates and high prices."
"May 22, 2013",50,Keens has always been there!,"Keens has always been there! Always! Always with the same high end quality, first choice of meat and great cocktails. Still a nice spot for aperitiv or after lunch . Try the burger at the bar if you want to “save” some money "

"March 30, 2013",50,Fantastic meat,"Fantastic steakhouse! We had three different kinds of meat, all good! The smashed potatoes and the spinach were fantastic! Great restaurant ! Only one problem: it closes at 10:30pm."
"March 29, 2013",30,Something is missing...,"Mutton Chops were very good, ambiance full of tradition, service professional BUT....it looked like a factory floor where everything was meant to be efficient, fast and profitable...the NYC way...basically, very expensive (360$ for four people) and pushed out by the hour. No charme, no soul"
"March 29, 2013",50,Excellent Food!,We went here a few months ago and really enjoyed it. Everything was delicious and it was packed. There's a reason as to why this establishment has remained so popular. See my blog for a longer review: www.gustatori.com

"November 6, 2012",40,Best Thick Juicy Lambchops,"A mid town institution with unique lamb chops. Generous portions. Good food,but crowded, low ceiling decor. Near Macy shopping district and Madison Square Garden. Menu is average among steakhouses; service acceptable."

"October 10, 2012",30,There are better options,"If you love steak then please visit wolfgang's on park ave, the Tribecca location is not great, but the park ave one is heavenly. Keen has the same sort of food, but they don't make it as good as other places in NYC."
"October 8, 2012",40,Great ambience and good food,Very good food but not astounding. Very similar to Ruths' Chris or Delfriscos. Super cool place in terms of history and atmosphere but the food didn't really stand out.

"September 26, 2012",50,Old School...never goes out of style,Get a drink at the small bar or grab lunch/snack before heading to the theatre. Better yet..take some friends and order the chops. Enjoy the smoking pipes that hang every where.

"August 28, 2012",50,Old school.. the best of the best... Do it,The steaks or the salmon... the salad with blue cheese too is delicious. Doubt you will ever regret going to this place...even if the bill is high (but certainly not as high as the many newer steakhouses). A classic.

"July 22, 2012",50,Best steak ever....,Choose this as 40th birthday dinner for my wife whilst in Manhattan...and were'nt disappointed. We shared a chaeteubriand steak done to absolute perfection and managed to squeeze in a new york cheesecake. Quite possibly the best dinner we have ever had..

"July 16, 2012",10,Not value for your money !,"The filet mignon had no flavor. The prices were extravagant. Potatoes $12, enough for one person. Broccoli $8.00 for a few crowns...ridiculous. It would be fine if the food were spectacular, but find another steak house. This was a waste of $100 per couple !"
"July 11, 2012",50,The Best,They don't advertise they don't have to it took me 20 years of rumor to find this place What a shame...The lamb chop and steak is tops..I don't like Lugers been there 5 times THis is the top

"July 10, 2012",40,Delicious and Memorable,Visited Keens with a group of nine for a special occasion. Was disappointed initially that we had to wait an extended period of time for our table but management did quickly rectify once we brought it to their attention. Also felt that they went above...More
"July 10, 2012",50,So Professional,Our waiter's name was Bob and he was a professional and a gentleman. I told him that this is my first time in a steak house and I need his help. Also my wife could not eat a big steak like I do and we like meat in different tempretures! He made some changes in menu and made it useful for us. I understood that they normally don't make this changes in menus but he went to kitchen and talked with someone. When he came back they were ready to prepare a steak for us ( half of it would be well done and half of it would be medium rare) He recommend wine also! We waited around 40 minutes but results were fantastic! We were both over clouds at the end of our meal! He came to check us every 10 minutes and he was ready to change anything we didn't like. But it was impossible to change or dislike in this restaurant.  Thank you Bob!  Please be aware that it will be better wearing formal or pants and shirt when you go there. If you make a reservation you will probably have a better table!
"July 9, 2012",50,elegant and delicious,Certainly a masculine feel in this awesome club-type restaurant. Loved it.
"July 9, 2012",50,Biggest steaks ever,"We have been to a lot of high end steakhouses and never before have we seen such huge steaks. Beautifully cooked, wonderful service and large dessert menu too makes it a great place to have dinner."
"July 9, 2012",30,Overpriced for the food,"Service at Keen's is top-notch, so I won't even bother going into my review on that.  However, I've been here on several occasions and have always been impressed by the food, with the exception of my last visit which was distinctly disheartening. I usually look forward to eating here, because, to be honest, before last week, this was my favorite steakhouse in the City. They used to season their steaks perfectly, then cook them to your preference, and all in all it's an expensive, but very worthy meal for special occasions.  So imagine my shock when I order the same think I have gotten, time and again, (the t-bone steak, medium rare) and it comes out tasting super bland. I wanted to cry. But I couldn't - I was the only girl in a crowd of men, who got together for a friend's birthday bash - and I didn't want to stand out from our crowd anymore than I was already. Not only that, I had told several of the guys, who weren't sure what to order, that the t-bone is the best I'd ever had and they ordered the same. I fear very much that they think I'm a nutcase for suggesting such a tasteless huge hunk of meat and calling it my fave. I didn't know these guys well otherwise I would have apologized profusely - but they are friends of my husband's friend, whose b-day we were there to celebrate, and whose wives/girlfriends/etc. were supposed to join them, but apparently all bailed at the last minute. Awesome.  Anyway - truth be told, we spent over $120 a person - but that included drinks, shared apps, shared sides and entrees for everyone (no dessert or coffee though). This time around, it just wasn't worth the price in my opinion. And my husband is going to have a hard time convincing me to return, although he swears that the mutton chops are to die for."
"July 9, 2012",30,"Nice Steak, Mediocre Service","I stopped in for solo dinner while on business trip to NYC. I had a crab cocktail, filet and side of mushroom caps. The crab cocktail was nice, typical of any higher-end steakhouse in NYC. The filet (ordered medium) was delivered on the other side of medium rare (cold, red center). Still a nice steak, but needed about 3 more minutes. Mushrooms were nice, portion big enough for 4. The service was slow and rather disinterested which was surprising as the place was only 2/3 full. For example, no one made the obligatory visit a few minutes after the food was delivered to ask about my undercooked steak. In fact no visit at all until I had finished. It even took more than a few minutes to receive and process the check."
"July 6, 2012",50,Was amazing in every way.,"My favorite cut has always been a bone in ribeye, and strangely enough they didn't have one. I went with T-Bone and wife went with the filet. Both were exceptional. The T-Bone must have been over 30 oz. Really neat decor, as they had news papers from the 1870's, and pipes from people like Babe Ruth, Albert E, and Teddy R. Great experience!!"

"April 25, 2012",40,*Delicious* steaks; LOUD bar scene,This's a great end-of-a(nother)-hard-biz-day place to quaff perfectly-mixed drinks and wolf down major meat (& potatoes & creamed spinach). But it's usually too loud & crowded to be a tourist's pleasure. Do come 'deal with it;' just don't expect gentililty.
"April 24, 2012",40,Lovely steaks,"Went for Porterhouse which was huge, even to share! Next time, will get chateaubriand instead"
"April 23, 2012",50,Keens Steakhouse,You have top try the Mutton! Great spot for a business dinner that is not your typical New York steakhouse.
"April 20, 2012",50,As Good As Ever!,I remember going to this restaurant as a child many years ago. I just returned with my family and we all enjoyed it very much. It is definitely expensive!

The service was very good. Our waiter was very knowledgeable on his food and the drinks! The only downside for us was the tables were very close to each other and could therefore hear the next tables conversation.
"April 10, 2012",50,Wonderful local steakhouse,Keens deserves it's reputation for one of the best steakhouses in NYC. One of the pleasant suprises is that it can get the food out on time at lunch time and you can be in and out withn the hour and this is in the main dining room. The food is reliable and the service is solid and pleasant a lot better than people expect at the steakhouse. Just one small recommendation is that can you get new delph the existign ones are old and scratched and do not enhance the lovely food. Thank you.
"April 10, 2012",50,The best food and service of our trip to NYC.,"We went to Keens on Easter Saturday, I had booked but we were early, this was no problem. The food was fantastic and the people laid back but attentive; we chose the Porterhouse and it was superb. Our waiter was great, he was always around but not pushy and when asked for advice on the best Malbec he said they were all good so pick the cheaper.  We will go back to NY and I will go to Keens again."
"April 9, 2012",50,What a surprise!,"Japanese friends of ours recommended that we join them for a steak dinner at Keen's. We headed to 36th Street thinking we might be in for a few artfully arranged stips of Wagyu dipped in a ponzu sauce. Were we off target! As initiates know, Keen's is a rock solid, old school steak house, and a very, very good one at that. My filet mignon finished in the ranks of the top five steaks I have eaten...I cannot rank them beyond that. My normally light-earting spouse did honor to her steak, too. We split a slice of cheesecake for dessert--my wife and I agreed that it was the best slice of cheesecake we have been served in our half century of dining out. It was light and had a fresh, zesty flavor. We'll return for the cheesecake, if nothing else.  Our friends had a tiny baby along. The staff at the restaurant was most obliging in getting the baby's crib placed in a way that would allow the baby's parents to enjoy the meal fully.  If I had bothered to check Trip Advisor before we left for the restaurant, I would not have been as pleasantly surprised as we were. For once, I am glad we did not consult Trip Advisor in advance."
"April 9, 2012",30,Chophouse with history,"We ate here for the first time on Easter Sunday. The place is steeped in history. The service was adequate, but not as attentive as I would of expect for a 5 star restaurant. The portions were huge and were seasoned we'll although definitely not the best steak I have ever eaten. Only one side of my t-bone was really edible. The atmosphere is a little stuffy and depressing. The sides are superb."
"April 9, 2012",50,Delicious!,"We ate at Keen's recently and it was fantastic! We made reservations through Open Table and our table was actually ready early. Our steaks were cooked perfectly, just as we had ordered. Sides and desserts were also good. The service was great, never had to wait long for anything or ask for refills. Would go back again!"
"April 9, 2012",40,Steak in a great atmosphere,Porterhouse was fabulous and fed all four of us. Cooked to perfection and very tasty The atmosphere and history of this place makes it a very pleasant place to dine. Service was ok but not overly attentive.
"April 9, 2012",30,Good food bad service!,"Went for dinner in Keenes last night ,food was good , but unfortunately the whole experience was ruined by our waiter who it seemed could not wait to get us out of there .Compared to other US steak houses this resturaunt is below par ."
"April 8, 2012",30,Keens very uninspired experience.,"Nearby MSG Keens has the atmosphere and the welcoming feel of a great steakhouse. Bartender could not have been more unpleasant and disinterested in serving us. Sat upstairs big mistake . Service good . Shrimp cocktail pathetic, tasteless shrimp. Pacific Halibut was lukewarm and came with beans and escarole, bland and uninspired. Crab cocktail not very fresh. Friends Strip steaks were enjoyed. Fries were cold. For MSG events go to Nick&Stefs at MSG much better food and overall experience. Keens needs to shakeup their seafood experience. Overall uninspiring."

"February 11, 2012",50,Old School,This place does it right all the time. The mutton chop is as advertised and the portions are enormous. Maker's Mark Manhattan at the bar before dinner and make your way to your table for a great wine list and spartan eats.
"February 11, 2012",50,"Traditional steak house, great in the winter","Come linger upstairs, or get a table near the fireplace with someone who you have a lot of catching up to do with. Fabulous old school steakhouse with friendly staff and great steaks & sides."

"December 31, 2010",50,Great Experience,The steakhouse is a warm welcome. It has a charm all of its own with the pipes lining the ceiling. They give you probably one of the best steaks with little to no seasonings. Everthing about this restaurant makes you think New York.

"November 24, 2010",50,"By far, the best Filet Mignon I have ever had!!",Went to Keen's without any expectations and it really was amazing. The service was great and the food was top notch. I recommend they crank up the A/C a bit because it was hot in there. Overall it gets an A+ for quality.
