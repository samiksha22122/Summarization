The service is quick and accurate, particularly at peak times such as evenings and weekends, we ordered our food and within 5 minutes, the starters were on the table.  The food is delicious and portion sizes perfect, I have never had a poor experience visiting this restaurant and I have visited A LOT. When you ask for something, you get it without hesitation or delay and whats more.. The prices are competitive.

"November 3, 2011",10,Just awful,Why oh why do people queue to get in to this cheap tacky place do people in Belfast not know what good food tastes like . I'm convinced they use food from Iceland.
"October 31, 2011",40,"Great value, food delicious",Excellent service and great value. If you're looking for a family friendly Italian restaurant then I can highly recommend Villa Italia. Food was delicious with had enough choice to keep everyone happy. No surprises with the bill either.
"November 28, 2011",40,Good Italian food.,"We've been to Villa Italia a couple of times, and enjoyed the restaurant on both occasions. Although you can't reserve a table, we weren't long waiting, and it was certainly worth the wait. The restaurant is really pleasent inside, and although large, feels good because...More"
"November 26, 2011",50,"A wonderful, well priced, family dining experience.","My daughter decided to treat us to dinner out and since we have been attending this restaurant for many many years this was her choice. We were here on a busy Thursday evening but were seated almost immediately. Some times there can be a bit of a wait, as they only take bookings for large groups. The restaurant is primarily family based, but caters for all ages & group sizes and whilst it covers 3 floors, it is welcoming, intimate, and always has a wonderful atmosphere with nooks and crannies and split level dining areas on every floor. My daughter had chicken strips as a starter, and my wife and I split a portion of bruschetta. Both were deliver promptly, and the strips could not have been hotter. The bruschetta was fresh and fragrant with basil. Lovely. Pizza is a must at Villa Italia with the picante being our favourite. Our daughter got a small pizza which was more than ample for one. I had loin of cod in a wonderful creamy mustard & cheese sauce which was cooked perfectly. The sides of broccoli, cauliflower & carrots, with baby boiled potatoes were perfect accompaniments. My wife had a lovely chicken fillet, wrapped in filo pastry and she ordered garlic potatoes as a side. All the dishes were well cooked."
"November 20, 2011",40,Never disappointed.,"I have been coming to this restaurant for about 20 years and it has always been an enjoyable experience.  It's good for any size of group, just 2 people or even dining alone.  Unlike many restaurants in Belfast there is no loud intrusive music, so you can actually enjoy a conversation.  The menu has changed little over the years, which is not a bad thing in my book. Their lasagne is particularly good.  Last week I was there with a couple of workmates and we had a lovely relaxing time and all enjoyed our food. One person asked for two starters instead of a main course and they didn't make a fuss like some places do, just served them quietly and efficiently."
"November 20, 2011",40,Very nice place,I was there with a friend and for both of us it was nice experience. I would certainly go back but next time I will try something else from their menu. Food portions were indeed too big and the pasta I had was really nice but not too exciting. As a dessert I had Tiramisu which I would not recommend (I found better in Tesco). On the bright side it is a lovely place with fantastic atmosphere and good service! And I would still recommend it.
"November 15, 2011",40,italian food irish atmosphere,"We had dinner with my family, wife and adult daughter in Villa Italia last week. It's regarded as maybe the best Italian restaurant in Belfast. The pizza was excellent, vine good, pricing reasonable. In addition to pizza there seemed to be nothing else really Italian. Food other than pizza seemed o be quite much like Irish food served elsewhere, too fatty with chips, but lots of pleased customers proved of good quality. Recommed"
"November 7, 2011",50,Reliably excellent and wonderful service,I love this place. It is always lovely and great value too. The food is fab and it is so child friendly too. A must to visit when in Belfast
"November 3, 2011",10,Just awful,Why oh why do people queue to get in to this cheap tacky place do people in Belfast not know what good food tastes like . I'm convinced they use food from Iceland.
"October 31, 2011",50,"Huge Portions, Fantastic Ambiance, Great food",Walked in off street on busy Saturday evening and got table within minutes. Some of the main courses were also as starters and the main courses were big portions that none of could finish and unfortunately we did not have room for desserts. Wine was very reasonably priced; jugs of water were automatically refilled. Lovely atmosphere had real Italian authentic feel to the place. Good value for money and food itself was as near to the real McCoy as could be. Will return.
"October 31, 2011",40,"Great value, food delicious",Excellent service and great value. If you're looking for a family friendly Italian restaurant then I can highly recommend Villa Italia. Food was delicious with had enough choice to keep everyone happy. No surprises with the bill either.
"October 30, 2011",40,Great Value for money,"I visited Villa Italia with my sister and our boyfriends, when we got there the queue was out the door but we were actually seated quite quickly, only had to wait about 10 mins. The food is really good, I had the beef fillet which was melt in the mouth and came with a side order of veg and potato so there was plenty of food. The four of us had a starter, main course, dessert, a bottle of wine and beers the cost was only 35 pound per person, which i felt was really good value. I would recommend a visit here as the staff were also very friendly and couldn't do enough for us, my only gripe would be that it was way too hot in the restaurant so an investment in some air con would make the experience more comfortable :)"
