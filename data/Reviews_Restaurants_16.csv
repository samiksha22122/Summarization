They had started their drinks before we managed to get hold of another waitress asking were our drinks and food were.  Unfortunately, we don't think she was having a good day as the wine was just dumped on the table with the starter, no side plates or water. Seemed like we really put the lady out when we asked for the plates and water.  Another waitress came up (the lady we placed the order with) and apologised, getting the plates and water.  Nice food, nice area just bad timing."
"June 3, 2015",50,Great pizza in Rome:),Great place.. we spent there lovely afternoon eating pizza and having drinks. The owners are great and nice people. We really liked it..! Thanks guys:)
"May 29, 2015",50,Great Pizza at a reasonable price,Love the pizza. Owners are very friendly!!! Great snack or lunch. Better pizza than any other place around it.
"September 13, 2015",50,Great pizza close to the Vatican,"After climbing the dome this was just what I needed. Very friendly service and tasty pizza. Small appetizer, 2 nice slices and a coke for 8.30 ‚Ç¨. Place can be a bit hard to find. If you come from the Vatican and cross a road...More"
"September 7, 2015",50,Absolutely The Best,"The pizza would have been enough to allocate all five stars, but the service went above and beyond. Everything was perfect in this quaint pizza shop just outside the Vatican. On a row of significantly larger restaurants, this seemingly small storefront offers you the best combinations of toppings paired with the perfect cheese and sauces. The man in the front (sorry, forgot his name) was so stinkin' friendly that j forgot I did not know the language of the city. He offered explanations and recommendations and brought our food to us perfectly sliced and heated so we could share in the joy of true Italian pizza. Loved it. If my boyfriend wouldn't look at me sideways I would go back there for lunch every day."
"September 7, 2015",50,"""Great post-Vatican Lunch""",My girlfriend and I were looking for a quick bite after touring the basilica and Zizza was perfect. Delicious pizza and I couldn't believe the price. Definitely worth a stop.
"July 29, 2015",50,"Excellent pizza , great tastes","Great and lovely service by the two gentlemen, great tastes with all kinds of toppings you have never dreamed of, good atmosphere and close to the Vatican"
"July 23, 2015",50,Lovely little place,"This is a lovely tiny place, can be easily missed if your not careful! This was about a ten minute walk from our hotel as me and my husband felt a bit peckish one evening.  It is run by two brothers and they're absolutely lovely. Service was quick and pizzas hit the spot! Lovely fresh and tasty.  Would highly recommend."
"July 12, 2015",40,Close to our B&B,"Close to our b&b. The owners are super nice and speak good English. The owners are young brothers. The restaurant is small, more a place for a quick snack. The pizza is great, especially the ones without tomato sauce, soooo crispy!  When we got there, it was a super hot day, the cook came and sprayed cold water on us :) and they gave us free dessert.  TIP:  If you are staying at the via bicolo b&b (great place), after a long day of walking, buy angels&Demons the dvd, take some pizza and cold soda from the pizza zizza brothers, go to your apartment, turn the ac on, turn the movie on and enjoy some great pizza while watching Robert Langdon racing threw Rome!"
"July 10, 2015",30,Nice food,"Think we picked a bad time. Sat down for an evening meal after a long day sight seeing. Orders a bottle of wine, bottle of water, a small starter between us and two meals. The meals were out of stock so we advised we would have another look whilst we they get the drinks and starter sorted.  Another couple sat next to us and ordered drinks about 5 minutes later. They had started their drinks before we managed to get hold of another waitress asking were our drinks and food were.  Unfortunately, we don't think she was having a good day as the wine was just dumped on the table with the starter, no side plates or water.
