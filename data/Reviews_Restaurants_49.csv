15 December 2019,50,Amazing produce,The steak here is amazing! Beautifully cooked and with great sides. The staff are really helpful and their recommendations (especially the red wine and Stilton sauce) were great. Not the cheapest but totally worth it for a pre-Christmas treat!
1 November 2019,20,Not as good as usual,The steaks were a little hard on the outside and I think a little overcooked. Disappointing. I have used Goodman for many years and it‚Äôs always fantastic. The Waitress was great and offered to change the steaks but at that point it‚Äôs too late.

16 March 2018,50,Top quality steak,Very friendly waitress who explained all of the different choices very well. And all of our steaks were of excellent quality and all cooked exactly as ordered. Good cheese board and red wines. Not cheap but not obscene either.

13 August 2017,40,Lunch,We came here for lunch a few weeks back . Food was good nothing to complain about serivice was good too. Difficulty get served at the bar and it wasn't busy just ignoring me ! Would recommend it was pleasant enough .
25 July 2017,50,You are unlikely to get a better steak in London,Now Goodman is my favourite steak restaurant in London bar none. I have been fortunate to eat in both the City and West End restaurant and without fail the food is brilliant. The rib of beef is to be beaten!
25 July 2017,40,Very Good Steak Restaurant,Very good service and food. I was not feeling at all well so not my best dining experience but it was a good steak place and I would guess very good for bigger business lunches and dinners. Prices typical of a London Steak House.
15 June 2017,40,Very good steak,A very nice steak restaurant in central London great steak done as I like it service was good a bit expensive but very good
4 June 2017,50,Great meal,"What a great place to eat. Swift and polite waiters. Not long after comming into the restaurant, we were served drinks promotly. Not long waiting for the meal, which was just SUPER!!! Try it outüëçüòÑ"

10 May 2017,50,Fantastic steak & Wine,One of the best steaks in London great service although they lacked any Sauternes for desert. We shared two 700g rib eye one USDA and one from Spain both had merit both cooked to perfection!
24 April 2017,10,Expensive. Overrated.,Steak no more than reasonable. Accompanying dishes poor. Potatoes and mushrooms simply laced with harsh tasting garlic. Poor value for money.
13 April 2017,50,Great service,"The food is good but it is the service that stands out in this place. Fast and efficient, not much more you could ask for. Steaks were excellent as well."
5 April 2017,40,Business lynch,Excellent service and food quality at this restaurant. Well worth a visit on business or pleasure. Recommend the surf and turf.
21 March 2017,50,Great steaks. Good service,High end prices and quality to match. Steaks are impeccably cooked and wine list is extensive. I had a grass fed Polish t-bone but the accent here is on imported USDA certified beef and domestic Scottish beef.
19 March 2017,50,Just visited the bar,Went to the bar for some drinks with clients after lunch. Service impeccable as always from everyone at Goodman.
7 March 2017,50,Amazing,Amazing food. When I mentioned we was there for my boyfriends birthday they brought out a free cake with candles.
20 February 2017,50,Really good steak,Tried the chateaubriand and really enjoyed it. Accompanied by a couple bottles of Malbec. What more could you want on a Monday night.
20 February 2017,40,Amazing,Lovely steak and relaxed atmosphere. Mac and cheese was amazing! Truffled chips weren't really any different to normal chips and steer clear from the carrots. 10 x better than hawksmoor and M almost as good as Gaucho
15 February 2017,50,Anniversary dinner heaven!,"5* service, amazing food. As always with Goodman you know you're in for a good night. Being a city branch there are a lot of 'suits' but once you get over that it's a great experience! Highly recommended"
13 February 2017,40,Amazing Steak,"Nice steak house, very civilised, comfortable. Great Steak - remember to order vegetables and sides as only on its own. Make sure you're hungry on the bone steaks only available at certain pre cooked weights so can be very large"
9 February 2017,50,King of London Steak scene,"We're spoilt for choice for high end steakhouses in London but this place has it down to perfection. Nice furnishings, classy service, superb starters, steaks and sides and fair price for the quality you're getting. Can't fault it at all."
4 February 2017,40,Good Meat,"This is a place mainly for men , first time I have seen such a concept but it is working and the place is big and was very busy, good service with very reasonable prices."
14 January 2017,50,Great Porterhouse,"Great business dinner for 4 people. All shared a porterhouse, 850g, which was sublime! The Chablis was also to die for. Give it a whirl. Great atmosphere too."
6 January 2017,50,Not just a good steak,"The steak was terrific as expected, but the starters and sides were also a knockout. Try the prawn tempura or the caeser salad which are great for , also loved the relaxed atmosphere."
31 December 2016,50,Amazing steak,Lunchtime catch up over an awesome meal. The prawn tempura was outstanding. The steak menu was fantastic - I opted for a rib eye. No doubt the best steak in London beating my old favourites Gaucho and Hawksmoor.
19 December 2016,50,Management lunch,"Great service, knowledgeable staff about meats and wines, would recommend and return again soon. Restaurant has a great atmosphere, but you don't feel like you are sat on top of each other."
18 December 2016,50,God I love steak,The steak here is always brilliant and although there are a few places who can offer steak as good (or maybe better) you can't touch them on their sides and wine menu.
14 December 2016,50,Yum!,My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at Goodman City and it was fab! Not only was the steak great but they presented us with a personalised desert! If your a steak fan it's a must visit location!
12 December 2016,40,Excellent,"A City restaurant specialising in steak. A nice interior with very attentive, knowledgeable staff. The food is of excellent quality at london prices, some items on the menu are reasonable value, burgers etc.."
21 November 2016,50,Good Steak,Very nice steaks. The service was good. Wine list was good. This is one of my favourite steak restaurants in London as a result. Reliably very good. I would recommend it to anyone
8 November 2016,40,Great steakhouse with other food options,"Went for lunch having booked online. Service was really friendly and knowlegable. Liver pate, steak and fish particularly good. Only negative was price which clearly are City prices. In particular wine was overpriced although good. Why do restaurants insist on marking up wine so much?"
9 September 2016,40,Proper steak,"Nothing original at Goodman - real steak and all the menu items you would expect from a quality steak house (although the fries/chips, were a bit disappointing). What they do is not let you down - you want meat, they have it."
6 September 2016,40,Grat Lunch Venue,Visited it today for teh first time. Had a fantastic starter and a lovely steal. The restaurant has great atmosphere and the waitress was lovely. I was a guest so did not pay but the menue looked reasonably proced. Great for business lunch
5 September 2016,50,Friday evening steak,"Booking for 10. Slightly on the expensive side but well worth it as a treat. Very helpful and friendly waitress, no stress. Will be back!"
19 August 2016,50,Very good food and service.,"I was very impressed with this restaurant. Excellent starters, very good quality meat, fantastic wine and an excellent service."
14 August 2016,50,"Great meat, great service, very drinkable wine",As title suggests. Loved the steaks - we shared three different cuts of meat on one centre plate. Best of 3 worlds. Wine choices were excellent too - see photos!
11 August 2016,50,Wow,I regularly frequent steak restaurants in London - see other reviews This place is the best Server Francesca provided great friendly service
11 August 2016,50,excellent place for good meat,"excellent place, nice food, nice service all you wish for if you are looking for good meat you should book in advance"

5 July 2016,50,Amazing meal,Awesome meal and melt in your mouth steak. I couldn't fault Goodman's and now I know what all the fuss is about. Very enjoyable and I can't wait to return.

17 June 2016,50,Fantastic atmosphere,Great service and staff from the moment you step foot in the door. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants that next level in their food experience
12 June 2016,50,Great memories,"The great service, atmosphere and food, and beer. We tried to visit this restaurant during our next stay at London, but we were disappointed, as it is closed on weekends"
9 June 2016,50,Tender-loin,"Made reservation based on a friend's recommendation and wasn't disappointed. Tenderloin cooked perfectly to my satisfaction, tender prime cut. I'm from Chicago, littered with steakhouses and this shop compares."
28 May 2016,30,"Very noisy, poor value.",My wife and I couldn't talk due to the noise. We ordered a porter 800gr it was made medium as requested but it wasn't what you expect for a ¬£80 dish. You can get a better steak for less.
25 May 2016,50,The perfect steak,My first visit but I'd have to say it was better than both Hawksmoor and Gaucho! I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for a perfect steak in the city.
21 May 2016,50,Best rib ever,"You better reserve a table or you won't get in. Very friendly waiter, and likely one of the best ribs I ever ate. And go for the spinach, it's delicious."
18 May 2016,50,"Lovely Restaurant, Good Atmosphere","Went to friends leaving lunch at this venue. I had never noticed this restaurant. Pleasantly surprise, although it was top market. I felt very comfortable. I loved the menu, the wine list and the atmosphere. I would definitely go back there."
1 May 2016,40,good,"good place for a excellent steak, the best rib eye matured full of flavored, great wines by the glass with great service , will be back again"
21 April 2016,50,Amazing,"Possibly the best steak in London Tried few others but this place really works It is not cheap, and it is a bit ""city"" i.e. male The steaks are amazing though"
31 March 2016,50,Beautiful Steak,"This food was amazing, definitely worth the price!! I had a fillet which was perfectly cooked and my boyfriend had the Goodman Ribeye which was huge! The Truffle chips are also a must!!"
23 March 2016,40,"Great steaks, too much salt applied before serving",Excellent steaks and all-round very good service. One point deducted because somebody in the kitchen was very heavy-handed with salt on our chips and a prawn tempura first course. This is something I've seen mentioned in earlier reviews and requires action from the restaurant.
17 March 2016,50,Brilliant Birthday Meal,"Visited Goodman with my wife for my birthday. Excellent steaks, great service and they offered corkage so we brought along a special wine for the occasion. There's a huge choice of steak places in London but this one is right up there."
13 March 2016,40,Great steakhouse,Really good meal. Basically steak and chips. We chose well to go with the Clos Vougeot. They did forget one of the side orders but overall very good
3 March 2016,50,Steak paradise,Tastiest steaks in London. Super service from passionate and knowledgeable staff. Cooked exactly as requested.
29 February 2016,50,Best steakhouse in London,Steaks are unrivalled and the wine list extensive. Expect the restaurant to be 95% men in suits but you will be too consumed with the steak to realise.
21 February 2016,50,The finest steak this side of the Atlantic,"Those that have travelled to the States have marvelled at just how good their steak houses are, well finally we in England have a steak house to be proud of that serves steak to salivate over!"

2 January 2016,40,Very good,"As always across all Goodman restaurants, the service was impeccable and the food was very very good. It was a very noisy environment so personally Goodman Mayfair is a more enjoyable dining experience."
30 December 2015,50,Superb steak,"Yet again Goodman deliver. Friendly service, great steak, great relaxed atmosphere. Good for business or with friends."
29 December 2015,50,Excellent,Service was impeccable. The wine was simply divine. The steak was incredible. The only minor imperfection was the chips were slightly over seasoned. Very well worth a visit bit please be aware the wine can get rather expensive! !
23 December 2015,40,A delight as always,Once again a far more pleasurable dining experience than some of the other ''Goodman's'' I have dined at. The service from our Hungarian waitress was exemplary. First class. The steaks as always superbly cooked and the side orders equally so. Really nothing to fault.
27 November 2015,50,My number one steak restaurant ..,.... And I have done a few ! Service was great - sommelier was spot on with wine recommendations .... And the meat was exceptional
23 November 2015,50,Joint best steak in london,Between us we had the standard Goodman ribeye at ¬£35 and a surf and turf with fillet and prawns at approx ¬£40. The ribeye is he beat I've had in London with only Goucho Smithfield challenging it. Certainly better than Hawksmore guildhall.
22 November 2015,50,Great restaurant for business lunch....,What a great menu and its a perfect venue for a working lunch. Staff are very good and there is a tempting wine list to enjoy. The steak in particular with a bottle of Cake Bread is always a winner!!!

26 October 2015,50,Great Birthday Treat,"Was taken here for my Birthday. Quite simply the best steak I have ever had, be it in the UK or abroad. Try the rib eye and you won't go far wrong."
2 October 2015,50,Exceptionally good,This is the best steak I have ever eaten. The choice of steaks and quality is superb. The service was good. Excellent knowledge of the food. Side dishes and starter were also excellent. Expensive but well well worth it for the quality of the food.

5 June 2015,40,"Great steak, but - a bit ovepriced (what is not in London!!) and a bit too self important","enjoyed a great teak but thought the place I too pretentious about itself. nevertheless, the California Reds are well selected and besides the bill, is all quite good."
21 March 2015,50,Loved it,"Had a business lunch here. Really enjoyed the food. I had my favourite cut, rib eye, and it was marvellous. Washed down with a nice Malbec and finished off with a creme br√ªl√©e, it was food heaven."

24 October 2014,50,Great!,"One of the top 3 steakhouses in London, no doubt about that. They know how to present their meat!!!!!"
24 October 2014,50,The best steak in London,"We have frequented a number of steak restaurants in London and New York, and have to say Goodman's rated as one of the best. Rib-eye and fillet cuts are exquisite and service great. Expensive overall, but justified by the quality of food."
24 October 2014,50,by far the best steak in London,Best steak money can buy in the city with amazing side dishes (truffle chips are a winner!) and perfect service
18 October 2014,40,Excellent beats Gaucho and Hawksmore!!,Excellent meat; cooked to perfection large 350 grammes; sides of truffle chips plus mushrooms were great Service by a young Texan student actor was excellent and he is knowledgable Much wider selection then their branch in Zurich and of course cheaper
15 October 2014,40,Wow what a steak,"I ordered a fillet steak, that was so juicy and tender, even though i had a medium to well done steak. The truffle chips were wonderful. The staff were polite and helpful. Dont miss a trip to Goodmans"
4 October 2014,30,Fairly predictable steak place,Consistent with decent US steak places but with a London price tag. The steak was prepared very nicely and I appreciated the range of sauces that they brought out with it. The lobster bisque was a disappointment as it boasted minimal lobster!
26 September 2014,50,best steak ever,The steak here was amazing! cooked to perfection - only thing I wasnt a fan of was the truffle fries as they over powered everything but that was personal taste.
13 August 2014,50,Magnificient!,"The Lobster Bisque, Pan seared Fois Gras, New York Sirloin, Truffle Chips and Cream Spinach are definite MUST Haves!!"
12 August 2014,40,Nice steak,Good steak and well prepared. Not cheap but much better than the shoe leather you often get in the UK. Sides also good. Didn't manage desserts.
9 June 2014,50,Excellent Steak,"Probably one of the best steak houses in London. Good selection of wines and great deserts. Although it's not cheap, it's well worth the money. Great atmosphere."
2 June 2014,40,Delicious food,Food was good. Friendly staff. I was here first time but would love to go back again for sure if i am back to london.
22 May 2014,40,"Great steak lovely wine , bit pricey","Really lovely surroundings, fantastic steak, just hurt a bit at the bill stage! Wine selection is excellent, but the California red we ordered was ¬£80 per bottle-great taste though."
18 May 2014,40,Friday night dinner,"Busy Friday night but the service was still first rate. The food was spot on but expensive. We ended up ¬£190 for 2 including drinks, but you could spend a lot more. Good atmosphere, and really busy."
12 May 2014,50,RIbs - Oh my world,Ridiculous good ribs - Thoroughly enjoyable. Went against the grain on this by not getting the steak but just as a starter the ribs rockeddd
2 May 2014,50,Great service and great steak,"Had a really good lunch here yesterday. The steaks were fantastic and the service was excellent. I asked for a quieter table by phoning ahead and they put us on a big table that they could wall off, very helpful."
22 April 2014,50,Love Goodman City,"Let me keep it short and simple if you want an amazing steak, good atmosphere and truffle chips (amazing) you literally cannot look any further. I don't drink so dinner came to ¬£80 for 2 and it was literally perfect."
17 April 2014,50,Good food with reasonable price,"Went during our London trip with my wife. She ordered a sirloin while I ordered the fish of the day plus three sides. All were great, and even better with great wine recommended. We spent around ¬£90 for mains, dessert and wines."
17 March 2014,30,Not my cup of tea,I don't really think it is a restaurant for every taste. The food is nice but not exceptional and the crowd is definitely gents for the city coming for dinner. Prices are high of course but not too expensive at the end
5 March 2014,50,PERFECTION,+ The best steak I have ever had! Absolutely worth the money + Brilliant service + Even the sides were like nothing I have ever had! AMAZING ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!
8 February 2014,50,Great American Steaks.,"A friend who lived in the USA recommended this place for its American steaks. It was not cheap, but the best steak I have ever had."
21 January 2014,40,Good Steak in the City,"Had a quick lunch with ine of my colleagues. Lobster Bisque - bit weak and too cool , but made up for by USDA Filet cooked t0 perfection!"
15 January 2014,50,Top notch food,Can't fault the food or the service they know their steak. Great place for a business lunch enough privacy to talk.
7 January 2014,40,Worth it,"Don't arrive expecting anything other than steak, but, by Crickey, it is a mouth watering delight. Waiting staff might be better informed and a decent ale wouldn't go amiss."
15 December 2013,50,Fantastic steak! Worth the price.,"Love this place, will be returning - better than its peer 'Hawksmoor' on the strength of the quality of the service and the food."
10 November 2013,50,Ticks all the right boxes,"Tiger Prawn Tempura for starters and 400G rib-eye for the main course. Absolute quality, delicious food and wine that ticks all the boxes."
23 October 2013,50,Fantastic food worth the price,I do believe I've found my favourite steak place! It isn't cheap but the quality is well worth it. I recommend it you go in a group to get a number of different cuts of beef and share family style.
22 October 2013,50,Goodman,Best Steakhouse in London (fact)! Been there so many times its like eating at home.. Also they serve the best Espresso martini's.. The manager and staff are very helpful and you never feel rushed during your meal..
16 July 2013,50,"Great starters, try the prawns.",Very good steaks and the prawns for starter are top drawer. Plenty of choice in the steak department. They will show you the options if you ask. Can't really fault. Gaucho might be better but close call.
19 May 2013,50,great steak house,"great steak, extensive wine list, very attentive but not intrusive service, bill not for the feint hearted."
17 May 2013,50,Not cheap!,"Fabulous steaks, the 1st in the UK that I have actually thoroughly enjoyed. I had a medium porterhouse around ¬£38. Good wine. Our American friends were full of compliments. If you have deep pockets make the trip! Bit noisy though for conversation in a group."
9 February 2013,40,Rather good value,"Value, good service, friendly and above all great steaks. 6 servings all accurate, and no problems at all. Recommend to anyone. I shall be returning."
3 February 2013,50,WOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW,"I had really high expectations of this place and it lived up to it all...Service, atmosphere and most importantly the steaks were AWESOME!!! Without a doubt this ranks as one of the best steakhouse around... As Arnie said in T2...""I'll be back..."" üòù"
23 January 2013,40,Great steak in the square mile,"I've been fortunate enough to visit Goodman on several occasions and not once has it been disappointing. If you enjoy a good steak, then this place is a must, and the truffle chips are also worth a try."
30 December 2012,30,Disappointing,"Given all the positives previously written about this restaurant, must admit disappointment. Three of us each had the Goodman rib-eye steak (USDA 400g) which was ok, but far from great. IMHO, Roast (in Borough Market) does a far better rib-eye steak."
19 December 2012,50,Good as it gets,"Food and service was superb. (they were a little slow delivering the first round of drinks, without any comment from us, they gave them to us complimentary as an apology. This is what service is about"
5 November 2012,40,WOW,"Have been here three times now and the steak has been fantastic and tasty every time. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Yes, the steaks can be expensive, but it is worth paying the extra for the exceptional quality."
2 November 2012,50,Excellent !,"Definitely a place to check out if you are in London and want to eat some quality steak. Wide selection of dishes , sides and deserts too!"
9 October 2012,50,Fab,"Steak is great, location good, restaurant dark but ambient. As good as Goodmans in Maddox Street, remember to order side dishes though. Service was attentive and as a result I have been back several times. Nice atmosphere."
4 October 2012,50,very nice for cosy lunch...,"Was a client lunch and the food in Goldman City was fab... I really enjoyed the steak and all my clients were also happy... I really liked Irish 400gr, can recommend, service was also very nice. Can recommend easily."
20 March 2012,50,Meat lover's delight for flavour and professional yet friendly service!,I too visited the Mayfair branch and was truly bowled over by the phenomenal service on top of some superb steaks. Our server Belle was an absolute diamond making my wife's 40th a ver memorable experience. Just go and try it! HF
21 January 2012,50,love their steaks and staff,"the atmosphere, the staff, the steaks are amazing - i have taken colleagues, clients and friends...many times and never had anything to complain about, it has been fantastic every time!"
9 January 2012,50,Best steak in London,By far the best steak in London that I have had. The truffle chips and truffle mac and cheese are to die for I highly recommend it.
16 December 2011,30,"not bad, but nothing special","Went there a couple of times for lunch and tried their steaks and burgers. They were okay, but I'd had both better steaks and burgers in London."
10 October 2011,50,"Excellent, if pricey","I still remember that steak I had three months ago, and for all the good reasons. Paying through the nose felt good, for once, which is rare in London nowadays. The only sour note were side dishes, simply not worth it."
7 October 2011,50,Really great food,"Excellent food and great wine selection , service was good , but could have been fantastic with a little more attention"
22 August 2011,40,Meaty!,"Went here with a client. Loved it. Steaks were great. Simple, with no one trying too hard to be clever. The steak is the show so if you are a meat eater and in the mood for steak, this is the place."
17 August 2011,50,Best Steakhouse in London!,Wonderful food supported by a superb wine list! Can't recommend highly enough
