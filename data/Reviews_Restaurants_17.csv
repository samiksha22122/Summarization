"August 27, 2015",50,the wine list and jonathan knew his wine.,from start to finish this was a perfect date night out. the dry aged beef is displayed in the window and the booth seating was very romantic and well furnished.
"August 24, 2015",40,No restaurant for old sissies,"Go for the american farmed Wagyu, rare, and you'll be happy. Perhaps not always the epitome in refinement when it comes to the sides but that's not why one went in the first place."
"July 21, 2015",50,pricey but yummy,Great steakhouse with excellent service and a price tag that matches. Nice atmosphere with live jazz music in the bar. Great place to eat before going to see the ballet or symphony. Parking was the only problem.

"September 6, 2014",30,"Ok, but not worth the hype",The food was just...good. Wine selection way overpriced. I get the same bottle elsewhere at restaurants for much much less. The lobster was overlooked. At $99 for the entree it should have been spot on.

"September 13, 2012",50,Delicious,"Harris steakhouse is a bit of a ride away from the wharf, but well worth the taxicab ride over. Everything we had was delicious. from the appetizers to the salads to the main course. Staff was very nice and very helpful with the menu. They...More"
"September 10, 2012",50,dinner,"LOVED IT! We had great service, steak and wine! I would go back in a heart beat. I wish I didn't eat so much so I could have enjoyed a drink at the bar to listen to the live music but you couls hear it in the dining room too."
"August 30, 2012",50,Best Steak Ever,"My wife and I ate the best steaks we have ever tasted at Harris'. I had a Pepper Steak and she a Diane. Pricey, sure, but service was superb; the wine list excellent and the experience one we will never forget."
"August 21, 2012",30,Average for a steakhouse,"The atmosphere was very traditional steakhouse except in the middle of the restaurant there were two huge houseplants separating the room. Our waiter was never outright rude, but he definitely had an undeserved air of superiority. I got a Caesar salad which tasted fishy, so my boyfriend switched with me and I ate the spinach salad. Nothing mind-blowing. For our mains, we both got the filet and a baked potato, and shared the Baked Alaska for dessert. The Baked Alaska was the best part of the meal besides the wine. The steak was nothing to write home about.  I wanted to try a local steakhouse while visiting the area, but I prefer Ruth’s Chris for the price and overall experience."
"August 8, 2012",40,Very good steakhouse,Ive had a better steak but the spinach and potato were great. Cocktails were good and the steak tartar was the best I've ever had.
"August 6, 2012",50,Classic Steakhouse!,"My husband and I traveled to San Fran for our honeymoon and treated ourselves to Harris Steakhouse. Harris is a classic steakhouse.... great decor with vintage looking leather booths and elegant finishings. Fantastic steaks! My husband had a Kobe steak there and I had the Filet. We started with, for him a Manhattan, and, for me, champagne. The remainder of each drink that wouldn't fit in our glasses was put into a little glass decanter and then put into a mini wine barrel filled with ice. It was really cute! Our waiter was great as well... service was excellent.  Highly, recommend."
"July 31, 2012",50,Lovely old style steakhouse with meat everywhere,"My boyfriend wanted a good steak on his last evening in San Fran so we came here after doing a bit of research. Harris was a great choice! We had a lot of fun looking at the different cuts of meat displayed in the butcher disk and also the meats lined up towards the street. The portions here are huge! We shared an iceberg wedge salad for starters, and although they didn't have the traditional variety on the menu our server fixed us up with a delicious variant: iceberg with bacon and blue cheese with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was absolutely delicious. For mains we shared a Porterhouse steak and as we don't eat potatoes our waiter suggested substituting with creamed spinache. Everything was perfect. The steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and was more than enough to share. Vegetables were crisp and the spinache was lovely. All in all it was a great evening with really good wine and drinks, a friendly and helpful waitstaff and as an added bonus we sat near a fun couple who we had a bit of a conversation with as well."
"July 15, 2012",50,Great Steak,"This is one of the top two or three steakhouses I've been to. We were seated in the ""casual"" area, but the atmosphere and service were as good as the main dining room. The steaks are out of this world. My wife and niece both had the Steak Diane and loved it (and my niece is not a steak eater). I had the bone-in New York strip. It was delicious. I would have gnawed the meat off the bone if I would have been at home. My nephew had the porterhouse and left less that I did. The potato of the day was au gratin potato and it was the best au gratin I've had in a long time. If you like steak, make it a point to eat here when you are in San Francisco."
"June 28, 2012",50,"Handsome place, fabulous steak","This is a classy restaurant that accepts casual dress. Tables are well spaced and the staff are most helpful. The steaks were excellent; I had the filet mignon, about 2 and a half inches of perfection, and my wife had the porterhouse, a huge slab of steak perfectly cooked. The steaks come with crunchy garden vegetables and a potato of your choice. Appetizers include the usual salads but I had a creamy parsely soup that was so good. Noise level was low. Wines are heavy California but many others as well . Prices are in all categories."
"June 24, 2012",50,What an institution.......,"We felt like part of San Francisco's history, Great place to people watch. Make sure you are in a booth in the main room. Fantastic steak, but you have to love meat as its everywhere !"
"June 8, 2012",40,Classy SF Steak House,"If you don't mind the high price, ask for the Kobe beef! Most likely the best steak house in San Francisco."
"May 28, 2012",40,Great food,We walked over because we couldn't get a seat at the House of Prime Ribs. It's a quiter restaurant but the food was just as good

"February 7, 2012",30,Overpriced,Nice setting - cosy bar/lounge - great dining room - very comfortable - good design - friendly service - first course was great - but the meat was overcooked (while we asked for medium rare) and tasteless - much overpricedU

"December 11, 2011",30,An Average high End Steakhouse,"The food quality and service were average for a high end steakhouse. I'd eaten at the House of Prime a couple of months before. My date and I both agreed that the House of Prime had a nicer decor, better service, and better quality food."
"September 26, 2011",30,Eh!,San Francisco is not a steak city. Harris' is supposed to be its best restaurant for steak. We've tried it a couple of times and found it always just blah.
"March 27, 2011",50,Very good,"Very good meal,very good service. what else can i say"

"August 12, 2010",50,Best steak ever,"Everything was absolutely fantastic from appetizer to dessert. The service was impeccable-first class. The steak was so tender I could cut it with a fork. Pricey, but worth it for every delicous mouthful."

"April 1, 2007",20,Not as good as Outback,"I ate at Harris' on 3/31/07 and probably won't ever go back. This is the third time I've eaten there and in each case I was charged about $43 for a fillet that was not anywhere near as good as Outback Steakhouse which charges about $20. The fillets I've gotten at Harris' were only about an inch thick and had noticable grissle. Outback's fillets are always perfect cuts of meat. Harris' simply are not worth what you pay for them in my opinion. The decor of Harris' is beautiful. Very upscale, very masculine. Everything a great steakhouse needs to be...except the steaks. Really disappointing."
"June 8, 2006",30,Good Steakhouse,Coming from NYC I guess I expect a bit more from a Steakhouse. Not that I have any really negative to say about Harris'. I enjoyed my meal and left with a smile. I just feel that when I spend $200 for dinner for 2 it should blow me away. I had the NY Strip she had the Filet. Both were very good and the potato was excellent.  I was a little disappointed in my special appetizer which was the Dungeness Crab Cocktail. I guess I didnt expect shredded crab. I loved the Martini barrel!  Good restaurant - but not worth going out of your way for. Service was excellent though!
"January 20, 2005",20,Bad Service Ruined a Good Dinner,"The steak was great. The caesar salads were the best ever. The service really was snobby, however. Our waitress failed to offer any sauces (oh my!!, just kidding, but she didn't offer, just one example). We tried to order dessert at the meal's end, but instead she plopped down the check and walked abruptly away. No ""Thank you..."" No ""Anything else?"" The meal was very expensive ($120 after wine, for two). We know this is San Francisco.. but even still.. a little bit of common courtesy would be nice. I wrote the manager later and he responded, pleading with us to come back. Frankly, although the food was great, there are too many restaurants in that area, and much cheaper @ that.. to waste our time returning to Harris'. Nice decor, terrible, impersonal service, great food. Steaks everywhere are either great, or okay. We therefore don't think it would be too difficult to get a good steak elsewhere in the area. Harris' rides on its reputation. Also, we could hear booming car stereo speakers as cars drove by the restaurant, outside (and we weren't by the window, either). Nice place, though, overall. We were a bit offended by the service, as this was supposed to have been an anniversary dinner (and the restaurant knew this). We've had friendlier service at Applebee's. No joke. Comparing Harris' to a place like Fifth Street would be like comparing Shakespeare to a comic book (Harris'). Oh yes, I asked for a refill on a drink, and never got one.. that was quite hilarious. The same girl waited on a table adjacent to ours.. we watched that couple wait, wait, and just look disappointed. We share a ""knowing glance"" at each other, silently saying, ""yes, the service here SUCKS and SUCKS BAD..."" Pretty hilarious. Again, $120--before tip-- to be treated like sh_t."
"November 8, 2004",50,best steak dinner ever,"At the advice of our hotel concierge, we made a reservation at Harris' for our 20th anniversary dinner. The cheese spread that accompanied the bread basket was tasty so we requested and were happiliy supplied with more. The butternut squash soup, a special that evening, was out of this world. I would have licked the bowl if it wasn't such a fancy place. The main attraction, the steaks, were perfectly cooked and delicious. It was the best steak my husband & I ever had. Service was professional and courteous. Seating was comfortable in a large booth. The only surprise was the $7 valet parking fee."

"November 21, 2007",40,Best steak I've ever had...,"Best steak I've ever had in a restaurant. Would say 5 stars, but it's pricey--very high end. The atmosphere is great though--you could imagine the Rat Pack sitting in a booth in the back smoking cigars."

"April 20, 2007",50,Great Steak - Old school classy,"I read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the less satisfied patrons. I took my wife and daughter here for wife's B-day. She loves steak and I had seen this place before, decided to give it a try.  First of all people must understand, the best west coast steak is probably a 6 out of 10 compared to mid west steak houses. I have eaten at Morton's in Chicago and Mortons in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, the Chicago steak is twice as good hands down. Same with Shula's and others. I found Harris's rib eye to be VERY tasty, cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful. Just as good as a Chicago steak.  The building is nicely decorated. It's old school high class motif. leather booths, high ceilings, large paintings.  The parking valet was professional and friendly. The hostess was prompt and friendly. The wait staff was very professional. The bus staff was equally as professional. The manager stopped by our table to check on us.  This restaurant measured up and did their job by the numbers. If I were a food critic I would have to rate it very high. I am not a professional critic, I'm just an average guy with a steak loving family who appreciates a fancy restaurant every now and then. We love San Francisco and our dinner at Harris's will forever be a pleasurable memorable experience. I highly recommend it to others. It is one of the best west coast steaks I have ever had."
"April 1, 2007",20,Not as good as Outback,"I ate at Harris' on 3/31/07 and probably won't ever go back. This is the third time I've eaten there and in each case I was charged about $43 for a fillet that was not anywhere near as good as Outback Steakhouse which charges about $20. The fillets I've gotten at Harris' were only about an inch thick and had noticable grissle. Outback's fillets are always perfect cuts of meat. Harris' simply are not worth what you pay for them in my opinion. The decor of Harris' is beautiful. Very upscale, very masculine. Everything a great steakhouse needs to be...except the steaks. Really disappointing."
"June 8, 2006",30,Good Steakhouse,Coming from NYC I guess I expect a bit more from a Steakhouse. Not that I have any really negative to say about Harris'. I enjoyed my meal and left with a smile. I just feel that when I spend $200 for dinner for 2 it should blow me away. I had the NY Strip she had the Filet. Both were very good and the potato was excellent.  I was a little disappointed in my special appetizer which was the Dungeness Crab Cocktail. I guess I didnt expect shredded crab. I loved the Martini barrel!  Good restaurant - but not worth going out of your way for. Service was excellent though!
"January 20, 2005",20,Bad Service Ruined a Good Dinner,"The steak was great. The caesar salads were the best ever. The service really was snobby, however. Our waitress failed to offer any sauces (oh my!!, just kidding, but she didn't offer, just one example). We tried to order dessert at the meal's end, but instead she plopped down the check and walked abruptly away. No ""Thank you..."" No ""Anything else?"" The meal was very expensive ($120 after wine, for two). We know this is San Francisco.. but even still.. a little bit of common courtesy would be nice. I wrote the manager later and he responded, pleading with us to come back. Frankly, although the food was great, there are too many restaurants in that area, and much cheaper @ that.. to waste our time returning to Harris'. Nice decor, terrible, impersonal service, great food. Steaks everywhere are either great, or okay. We therefore don't think it would be too difficult to get a good steak elsewhere in the area. Harris' rides on its reputation. Also, we could hear booming car stereo speakers as cars drove by the restaurant, outside (and we weren't by the window, either). Nice place, though, overall. We were a bit offended by the service, as this was supposed to have been an anniversary dinner (and the restaurant knew this). We've had friendlier service at Applebee's. No joke.
