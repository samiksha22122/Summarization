"January 20, 2019",30,A quick burger,"We can only give it an average rating but most likely our own fault, as we waited to the last minute to have lunch and having tickets for 2pm show meant we had to order what was quickly prepared. 3 burgers, properly done that we swallowed and run. They were good but I had better. Our server Christine was prompt, gracious and quick in providing us with the check so we could run!

"January 17, 2019",30,Average,"We visited here whilst in Times Square. We was advised of a 20 minute wait time but was told we could sit at the bar whilst awaiting a table. We was given menus and ended up eating there.  The food arrived quickly and was average, burgers the same as anywhere else.  The service was good, some staff are friendlier than others, several looked to be very unhappy in their job.  I witnessed a very frustrated customer trying to get several waiters attention whilst being ignored several times over.  The atmosphere is a bit chaotic and stressful as it is so busy here.  Some cool memorabilia on show.  Music odd for a ‘hard rock’ cafe. More chart music.  Not sure we would rush back."
"January 17, 2019",20,Big Birthday let down!,"I booked our table at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York to celebrate my 50th birthday.  We arrived in plenty of time to have a cocktail or two to build up an appetite, and were taken directly to our table, a tall bar table right next to the loud, crowded, busy bar! Not my idea of fun but hey ho, closer to the cocktails we thought. We chose our drinks, in souvenir glasses of course and sat back and waited. A waiter then took our food orders, sharing starters to keep us going, followed by mains, and still we waited for the drinks - given our proximity to the bar it wasn't difficult to work out they had been forgotten but a few glances in their direction prompted a spark and sure enough the drinks arrived. A few sips in and two servers arrived with our food, our mains! We laughed and pointed out we had not had our starter yet and turned back to the cocktails in hand. One server hovered in the background looking embarrassed but the other server was not going to be deterred and reintroduced the mains, waving them in front of us (obviously thought we were a tad blind, demented or both)! We reminded her we had ordered and indeed expected our starter to arrive before our main,it had now stopped being remotely funny. We tried to return to our conversation and drinks but she had other plans and asked us directly if we were refusing to accept our main courses before our sharing starter. We said we wanted our starter first, as was customary, but we were all quite embarrassed by now and didn't want the situation to get any worse, we needed have worried, our wonderful, customer focused server astounded us with what came next. We were asked, in front of the other customers (remember we were almost sat in the bar too) were we really going to refuse these meals! She reiterated how much food we were going to refuse and how wasteful we were choosing to be;""you really gonna choose to waste all this food folks"" she exclaimed to all, like any of this was our fault!!! The other server offered to take our food to keep warm in the kitchen but honestly, would anyone trust our delightful server not to ""enhance"" it in some way? I think not mate! Anyway by now she had dumped her two plates on the table, ruling out any other options,the food was here to stay. The mains were mixed up, wrong burgers, wrong sauces, wrong seasoning. We shuffled and shared from plates and kind of made up something like what we had ordered but who dared complain. The starter never appeared but a server came to explain that the mains had cooked before the starter, hence the mix up..... Incredible that anyone would ever attempt to cook them at the same timen but as our friends and fellow diners run an extremely busy London pub, who were they to correct the process! Embarrassing for all by now, time to drink the melted, warm cocktails and leave...... and no we don't want a bloody dessert (thanks for not asking). We have eaten in Hard Rock Cafes all around the world and I have to sadly say, this one in Times Square has made my birthday one to remember, for all the wrong reasons Sort yourselves out!!"
"January 16, 2019",50,"Great atmosphere, tasty food","Fairly early dinner, so before main rush, and seated straightaway. Staff very friendly and helpful. Loved the atmosphere and the food - the fries were delicious. Opted for non-alcoholic cocktails which were superb."
"January 16, 2019",40,Management was helpful,"We had over an hour wait ahead of us with two young kids. A manager saw us waiting (sitting on the floor) and saw that we had our hands full. He was able to get us a table within 20 minutes. It was much appreciated! Table service was slow and our food was served a little inaccurate, but it was yummy!"
"January 15, 2019",50,Last meal,This is the last place myself and my wife came too before we flew home and it was absolutely amazing food.

Chips were very tasty. The cocktails were big and you get to keep the glass when you leave (don't worry you get to keep a brand new one)....collect on way out.

I ordered the ribs, burger, Buffalo fried cauliflower and lots of beer. The ribs were not the greatest, the Buffalo cauliflower were good and tasted great.  Took a really long time to get the waitress to bring the bill. I had to talk to the head waiter in order to get their attention."
"June 17, 2018",40,Something for All the Family,"This is a very popular restaurant and is often busy. Go early, they will give you a time to return and expect to have to wait in the waiting room a bit. We went for a early dinner at 5pm were given a buzzer and had to wait 30 mins. This is pretty normal for this site. You will be disappointed if you expect to rock up and be seated immediately.  It occurs like a bucket list item to have dinner at the Hard Rock in New York City. We thoroughly enjoyed it.  We have been to different Hard Rocks before and find it has something great for all the family. And Time Square didn't disappoint.  The Kids Loved the kids menu, We loved the Burgers, Steak and Fajita's. And if you have room the apple pie/crumble is always a great desert.  Hard rock continues to deliver a consistent enjoyable experience. While not the best food you have ever had. It is good, enjoyable and consistent."

"May 29, 2018",40,Great food,"Long wait for table so ordered at the bar. Chicken Caesar salad was delish with plenty of chicken. Two pulled pork burgers were fab, couldn't finish them. Drinks were nice and cold, perfect. Prices are typical NYC."
"May 28, 2018",40,Great Burgers,"Burgers and music, that's what you want from Hard Rock Cafe. Both meat and vegetarian burgers were exquisite. Place can get crowded but it is not that noticeable when you are having a good time."

"December 30, 2016",50,Great Ambience,Rocking ambience. The food wasn't the huge portions that I expected it to be. They were small and average tasting burgers. Although the chocolate molten cake was scrumptious & it simply melts in your mouth!

"December 23, 2016",40,Always a good time!,"We dipped in here on a cold Friday night because the waiting area is inside. Awesome memorabilia everywhere. We were seated on about 35 minutes, great service and food was good. I would have rated 5 but our appetizer was lukewarm. Cool experience"

"December 17, 2016",30,Lunch with tourist friends,The food is average. You go more for the atmosphere and the name. The burgers and fries are good. It's a tourist thong to do.

"December 6, 2016",10,Stick to the gift shop,"If you want to wait for a while then pay too much for a mediocre burger in really cool looking very crowded surroundings then this is the spot for you. Otherwise focus on the gift shop, buy a Hard Rock pin then head for McDonalds."

"November 25, 2016",50,Prompt but cold,We hadnt booked and was seated within 10mins. Food was of a good standard as always. Only complaints.... lower 'deck' was cold and finished plates were taken away before everyone was finished. Maybe this is English politeness to wait until everyone has finished.

"September 13, 2016",50,Great atmosphere,Visited around 6pm and the place was full and the atmosphere was great. There was the usual photo opportunity and the cocktail with 'free' hurricane glass. Meal was very nice and the waitress was friendly. Well worth a visit
"September 13, 2016",30,Ok,Only had a drink in here. Because it was absolutely freezing inside could not sit and have a meal without my coat on. To many lovely places to eat.
"September 13, 2016",40,Amazing Hard Rock,"This Hard Rock is pretty big, the store has a vast selection of items, the restaurant is the trademark Hard Rock restaurant, great burgers as usual and free refills. If you want to eat here you should book your table at least the day before."
"September 12, 2016",20,Not the best!!,Stopped here for lunch. Not very busy but slow service. My wife had chicken fajitas which were okay but not hot sizzling and appealing. We finished our meal and left disappointed. Probably our most expensive meal of our trip and among the worst.
"September 11, 2016",50,Loved it,The place has a special atmosphere. Lots of lovely things on the wall. Staff lovely. Good n cocktails great and reasonably priced
"September 10, 2016",40,Saturday Dinner,"A very busy venue, but food and service normal HRC stuff, not cheap but four mains and dessert all eaten and enjoyed. Booked on the app really easily and walked straight in. ( why would you not book in this city)"
"September 6, 2016",30,Hard Rock Dinner,Largest Hard Rock I have ever been in. The waitress was very friendly and we got sat quickly considering how packed it was inside. Food was good. Shop was clean.

"September 9, 2016",40,Love it here,"Second visit here, really impressed with the service this time although we arrived after other members of our family who had been seated but the guy on the door didn't seem to know anything about this and was all a bit confusing. Once sat down, our server Estelle was excellent - very attentive and efficient, encouraging us to get up and look at the memorabilia - and the food was of good quality. Four of us shared the nachos to start and the portion size was huge - enough for a meal on its own. In fact all portion sizes were huge but very tasty, including ribs. It was pricey but expected in Times Square and a bit iconic - had to buy a t shirt and a photo!"
"September 9, 2016",50,Surprisingly inexpensive,Serving staff were excellent and friendly. The meal was what I would have expected of Hard Rock. Plenty of Tequila in their cocktail -You could taste the alcohol. Considering the fact that we bought the glasses I was surprised that the 2 meals came to was under $90. Food was hot and tasty and very filling
"September 7, 2016",30,Disappointed Cafe,"Do not go hungry at this restaurant expecting to be seated and eating 10 minuted upon arrival. The wait to be seated is insane. The service and food was good but you should stick to beers or water. The elevator is not conveniently located for disable people. When we were leaving, the elevator broke down and was out of service, no manager or employee was available to assist my friend who uses a cane to help with his walking. The lobby and waiting area are decorated with various famous rock bands picture and drums."
"September 7, 2016",40,Second time at the NYC Hard Rock Cafe,"I was reluctant to have dinner at the NYC Hard Rock Cafe after a lousy experience at this location several years ago, but we decided to give it another chance. One noticeable improvement is that the music wasn't deafening, which we've experienced at many other HRCs. We were seated quickly, but the service was just so-so. Our waiter wasn't very attentive, and we had to wait an inordinate amount of time before he ""appeared"" near us during our visit. I had the salmon, which was excellent, and my husband had the nachos, which was enough food to feed 2 or 3 people! I tasted a few of the nachos, and they were nothing to write home about. All in all, it was a mediocre NYC experience, but I do have to brag about the salmon, which I thoroughly enjoyed!"
"September 6, 2016",30,Hard Rock Dinner,Largest Hard Rock I have ever been in. The waitress was very friendly and we got sat quickly considering how packed it was inside. Food was good. Shop was clean.
"September 5, 2016",20,Very disappointed with breakfast,"We had breakfast here on our first morning in NY,we paid top dollar for a very limited,semi warm extremely boring buffet,our waiter was not interested at all,we were given everything we didn't ask for,and for 3 not 4 people,constantly had to ask for cutlery,salt & pepper,drink of water,service was dreadful,music was over loud! we couldn't have a conversation.We are in our 50/60s and by no means prudes,and like our music in the background.Somewhere we'd never go back too or recommend for our age group,too many great Diners/ Delis at very reasonable prices in the area. Maybe we were just unlucky."
"September 5, 2016",50,Fantastic,Excellent food friendly staff great place to visit plenty to see lots of memorabilia ! The store had so much to buy!
"September 5, 2016",40,"First visit to HTC, closely followed by 2nd","We popped in while shopping in times square and realy enjoyed our first visit to HTC, yes we waited 20 minutes to be seated, but they were busy. We enjoyed the food and even my somewhat fussy daughter was pleased with her plain cheeseburger, they even offered her a choice of cheese! My wife had a cocktail while my daughter tried her first ""mocktail"" with no alcohol and apparently they were lush, as was my beer. We found all the food lovely and the waiting staff very chatty and helpful. First visit done and paid for, my daughter asked to return befor we left NYC so take that as a thumbs up."
"September 5, 2016",30,Good once you get passed reception,"We booked online as we were arriving in NYC on a Friday night and thought it would saving us hunting for a place to eat. Despite this we were still messed around a little at the reception area. Once we were through we were seated immediately (on a wobbly table). Drinks order was taken quickly but not so quick to come out. Food was tasty, it wasn't cheap but no more expensive than most other restaurants."
"September 5, 2016",50,Family holiday to NYC,"Probably out best meal out experience as a family dinner. No queue, great staff, food yummy (ribs, fajitas), great atmosphere and photo opportunities. Loved the shop too. Kids had a ball and much laughter and discussion."

"May 9, 2016",30,Maybe too much going on,Sat at the bar. The bartender was pleasant enough but it took a while to get his attention. Decided to split a burger. The burger was well prepared but the fries were soggy. The place is massive but the experience should not be subpar.

"April 2, 2016",30,The same,When you go to one you have seen them all. Collecting drum sticks is the reason I go. The whole concept is outdated. Time for new things. Predictable in food and entertainment. But ok. Disneyland for musiclovers from the past.
"April 1, 2016",40,Meal card gave great value,"We had prepaid a meal and knoew our cjhoices, our server was very good and the food came quickly and the burgers were really good. You could have free soft drink refills."

"March 24, 2016",30,Portions too small!,The food quality was quite good but the portion size was a bit too small for my liking and they also got my order wrong. The theming was good and it carried through the whole restaurant.

"March 19, 2016",50,Nice dinner. Lively atmosphere.,"Nice dinner, lively atmosphere, everything you'd expect from a hard rock cafe, yes it was busy but we never felt rushed, good service and food was well presented. Crushed berry cocktail is recommended is you want a refreshing drink."
"March 19, 2016",30,What You Expect From Hard Rock,"The food at this location is like everything else ""New York""... Expensive!! The menu and loud, rock atmosphere is much like what you expect at any Hard Rock Cafe. I try to visit them everywhere we travel, but they are predictable."
"March 19, 2016",20,"Food was predictable, and service wasn't great",Same food as other locations but predictable and good for families. Our server wasn't at all on top of our needs. Mains were served before we were doe with our appetizers. Drinks were gone and we had to ask the manager about getting more.
"March 18, 2016",10,Horrendous service and attitude at host stand,"Terrible experience, went in at midnight, host said closed people dining, asked if open till 1am as advertised and posted, she said they are still closed. Will never go to Hard Rock again."

"March 13, 2016",30,Not the best Hard Rock,The waiting staff were really good however the food was pretty average. The ribs didn't have a lot of meat on them. Drinks were pretty good. Couldn't beat the location and decor.
"March 13, 2016",40,Great!,This is another must do in NYC - such a large venue and a great atmosphere. The food is 'ok'. A bit mass produced and bland but I guess you shouldn't expect everything from this place. Great for families and couples.
"March 10, 2016",40,First food stop,We enjoyed our meal here. The restaurant was clean and employees professional and courteous. If you have been to a Hard Rock anywhere else then this one is no different. The food was very good. And prepared as we ordered. No complaints. Would go again.
"March 9, 2016",30,Average food,I am sure this restaurant can serve better meals that I've got. And actually the atmosphere is not bad at all. But my hamburger felt a but synthetic.
"March 7, 2016",40,A must stop,"Very consistent for the quality of the service, food and drink. One of the best HRC for sure. Nicely decorated. Never come to NYC without stopping there for a drink or a meal!"

"March 3, 2016",40,Great food !,"Quick service,great food,polite and friendly staff. Very dark inside this restaurant which made it just a little depressing, music in here is really loud too so it's not really a place I'd take elderly people to, however the food was very good !"
"March 3, 2016",30,Not worth the money,"With a typical Hard Rock Cafe atmosphere, the service is not great and the food doesn't have the expected quality. The hamburger was dry."
"February 29, 2016",40,it's a must do for Rock fans,"when you are in New York and you are a rock fan, you have to visit the Hardrock Cafe. There is always a waiting line, but the food is good and also the drinks. and finally you have to buy the newest Hardrock T-shirts ;-)"
"February 27, 2016",40,A good chain restaurant,Having visited many Hard Rocks this one was not a lot different from the other. Like all the others I have visited the service is good and food very nice. This restaurant is in Times Square so can get very busy.

"February 20, 2016",30,Nothing Great,My teenage daughters and I walked in one freezing cold January night after taking a nighttime bus tour. It was cozy warm and the wait only about 20 minutes. The food was okay but nothing great. The staff was friendly enough.
"February 19, 2016",50,flatbread,"Stopped in for a quick appetizer, we shared a Margherita Flatbread f , it was so delicious. Service was great, not overpriced."
"February 19, 2016",50,Better than expected,Food was fantastic but portions are massive. Make sure when ordering desserts that you check whether it's for sharing or not! Service was great also.
"February 17, 2016",50,Consistently brilliant,"Came here with my husband and 2 friends. All of us had cocktails and food, both of which were amazing! The service was brilliant and I thoroughly enjoyed my time here! A must when in NYC"

"February 14, 2016",50,"GREAT LOCATION, HUGE PORTIONS, LOVELY STAFF","We popped in here for late lunch last Monday. Great atmosphere, lovely food, staff very friendly. Menu varied as you would expect, portion sizes HUGE."
"February 14, 2016",30,Family tradition!,It's now a family tradition that we visit a HRC wherever we are in the world. This New York HRC is looking pretty tired and is in need of some care and attention. Food was moderate and they had actually ran out of ingredients to...More
"February 13, 2016",40,Great furnishing,"As every Hard Rock Cafe we've been so far to, this one simply looks amazing from the inside with all those instruments/costumes once worn by famous musicians presented all around you. Apart from this unique atmosphere which is definitely worth a visit, in my opinion their burgers aren't that great, i.e. if one only looks for delicious burgers, there are many places in New York to go to which are way better. Reserve a tal"
"February 13, 2016",50,Combo,Me and the wife had a combo between us and a few drinks whilst sat at the bar . Good food . Drink a reasonable price and good atmosphere . Especially the barman a trick playing drums on an ice bucket and about 8 pint glasses with a knife and fork .

"February 12, 2016",50,Hard Rock at its best,"We went here for dinner, and have not been disapointed. Our waiter was really alert, and we never run out of drinks.  We started at the bar with a beer the waiter recommended to us, but it was not exactly my favorite. So he let us taste some more sorts to find the right one for us. We ended up ad XX (Dos Equis), a Mexican beer, which we knew from our holidays there.  The food was great, like expected, and there was nothing to complain about at all.  I would recommend going there!"
"February 12, 2016",30,2 hours wait,We arrived one evening for a table but the place was closed due to a private function so went the following night. We were told it would be about 1 hour but as it was our last evening we decided to wait. Unfortunately the wait was so long that I ended up shopping over the road while we waited. We did get our food much later which was OK but bland. The atmosphere and waiters made up for this and the music great. We purchased clothing from the gift store on sight so all in all a good evening.

This trip was no different. The wait time (for 2 of us) was minimal if we had to wait at all. The staff were super friendly, even though they we very busy.

"February 10, 2016",50,The best Restaurant I have ever been to,Coming from New Zealand when I am lucky enough to visit New York I always ask if I can be taken to the Hard Rock Café for dinner. Being a huge music fan it really makes me so happy

"January 14, 2016",30,Breakfast was tasty but it took AGES to arrive...,"Me and my boyfriend had breakfast here, I had French toast with bacon, he had some egg dish-the food was really enjoyable and it's a lovely venue, but we waited nearly 45 minutes after ordering to get the food. Pretty poor service."
"January 12, 2016",50,Delicious Hamburgers,"As all Hard Rock cafes the enviroment is awesome. Service was excellent. We tried a Strawerry lemonade that was delicious. Overoll we were very satisfied with our lunch,"
"January 10, 2016",30,Not the best but simple fare for tourists.,Went there after a late play for a burger. Burger was standard and nothing special but the fries were a little soggy. Typical price for NYC but better for a family as it is not above $$.
"January 9, 2016",50,Asked for ID lol,Had cocktails here on our first night. The girl who served us asked me for ID Made my holiday and I had just arrived. Pricey but that's fair enough
"January 9, 2016",10,Lunch,Did not enjoy food was not great Planet Hollywood was far better over priced for what it is Def will not return

"January 7, 2016",30,It's alright.,"I've never really seen the big deal with hard rock cafe personally. Its overpriced, completely targets tourists and isn't particularly great. This one did have a nice atmosphere to it though and service is fine, so I can't really complain in that respect."
"January 7, 2016",50,BREAKFAST!!,"the breakfast.... one word OMG!"" all you can eat and really good queality deffo worth a drop in to grab something to eat before a big day"
"January 6, 2016",50,Time Square Meal with music,"The bar is situated close Time Square, it serves nice food, great drinks and as usual in Hard Rock you are surrounded by a nice music."
"January 6, 2016",20,Poor breakfast,"Wen't there for breakfast. For 20 bucks you get slow service, a list of few dishes to choose from and best of all you get to rewards this bad experience with 18% automatic gratuity. First disappointing visit to Hard Rock Cafe."
"January 6, 2016",50,Excellent,"Lovely and enjoyable meal, true American food, cocktails were beautiful and our waitress was very nice and helpful! Enjoyed the photo when we first got there"
"January 5, 2016",40,Huge portions!,Service toke quite a while but it was worth the time. Food is really good and high quality. Portions are huge. Waiters are friendly. But the beer I got wasn't too good tho. Overall of 4/5 stars. Hard Rock Cafe is never disappointing 👍🏻

"December 29, 2015",30,Chain eating on the Square,The food is average. The wait staff is good at first but it is difficult to get a refill. You may only want to go to say you are at Hard Rock on Times Square.
"December 29, 2015",40,Noisy but nice friendly service,The noise prevented any conversation but the music and surrounding paraphernalia was entertaining. The food servings were massive and when we asked if smaller serves were available we were told that our request couldn't be accommodated. What a waste of food!
"December 29, 2015",30,Don't go without a reservation,Smaller menu than other HRC locations but of course pricier. I think about 20% more than the last time I went in September in Boston.
"December 28, 2015",30,Free with nyc passes,All I can say is iam glad it was free with our nyc passes . Very busy don't know what all the fuss is about food not great wouldn't go again disappointed really .
"December 28, 2015",40,"Great restaurant, very compatible to all other Hard Rocks","Good service received here as can be expected from the HRC.

"December 26, 2015",40,"Great Food, friendly staff",Sat at the bar since it was a 30 min wait for the dining room. The bartender was extremely friendly and the food was good. A little pricy but expected for Times Square.
"December 23, 2015",30,What experience am I paying for?,"Everybody says you should go to Hard Rock for the experience. After a fairly long wait, mediocre food, and an overpriced souvenir shop, I'm still confused as to what experience I invested in."
"December 23, 2015",40,Pretty good,My husband and I ate here for drinks and lunch one day. The food was good and we tried 2 of their specialty cocktails. Both were good but neither were great. Pretty good place to grab a quick bite.

"December 17, 2015",30,Average Food/Questionable Family Environment,"Food was average, server was energetic and friendly but the videos being shown on the screens were not for young eyes. Probably not a chain I will be rushing back to."

"December 15, 2015",40,"Great surroundings, ok food","The restaurant is exactly how one would envisage- glamorous, great atmosphere, really cashing in on its USP. The food was good but pretty blah, nothing too special. Definitely had an all-American feel to this place. Probably wouldn't go again though, having been the once."
"December 15, 2015",40,Hard Rock NYC,"We went to Hard Rock for dinner. They said it would be 45 min. To an Hour wait, but it was only 20 min.. Our waitress was really great, and our food was really good."
"December 15, 2015",40,Steak is amazing,"OMG! The steak was so good i couldnt finish it all. My only suggestion would be to ask for the next up of how you have it cooked at home, i asked for medium but it was more rare."
"December 15, 2015",50,Amazing atmopshere as expected!,We stopped here for a few drinks and were able to sit at the bar. Loved the atmosphere and the service couldn't be faulted.
"December 14, 2015",30,The restaurant was neat but food was blaaaa,The restaurant was a meet place but the food and service were pretty terrible. They butchered my order and did not fix it.Very busy because of the location and name but your definitely treated like just a number.

"November 29, 2015",30,very poor services,"We waited ages to be served, other people came in after us and had their meals before we even got our drinks! The food was good when it eventually came though. The drinks are not great though"
"November 28, 2015",40,An evening in Times Square,"Were seated very quickly by very friendly staff, who took an interest in us. Food upto the usual standard for Hard Rocks. Very wheelchair friendly."

"November 25, 2015",30,Decent Food but Slow Service,"If you have been to a Hard Rock then this is the same experience as all of the others. Overall the food was good but the service was kind of slow, we waited over an hour to get our food."

"November 23, 2015",50,Fab!,"Ate here last week while on holiday in NYC, Food was really nice, Cocktails were fab! Atmosphere was amazing... It's right on Times Square so a perfect dinner before heading off to a show in Broadway!"
"November 20, 2015",40,You know what to expect...,I did visit many Hard Rock Cafe's worldwide and the concept is repeating and you don't get suprises. The menue is always Burgerish & Beerish and there is always a souvenier shop. Had a nice burger with beer and got treated very nicely.
"November 18, 2015",30,Just ok,"Loved the venue and the memorabilia, food was just ok. Felt we were rushed from start to finish. Constantly pressurised for either photo,charity band purchase, glass etc. If you want a quick bite then it's suitable."
"November 17, 2015",40,Ok place,Sat down quite quickly after being shown to our table. When the food was delivered it looked very nice. I could not eat all of it as it was a good portion.
"November 17, 2015",30,Just like any other Hard Rock,Not the best eatery in town however if looking for a quick bite to eat this a good place to go. I do like the rock memorabilia - it is fun!
"November 15, 2015",40,"Good Food, very vibrant","If you want a nice quiet romantic meal then HRC is not for you. The service was good, the food was good, but really noisy. Music and videos are playing all the time."

"October 30, 2015",50,Great experience,"First visit to any Hard Rock Cafe. They didn't disappoint, the service and food was excellent. We had cocktails too which were really good. To top it off we saw David Baddiel but my wife was too chicken to say hello."
"October 30, 2015",50,Good value for money,A typical Hard Rock Cafe situated in the middle of Times Square. Both food and drink were reasonably priced and tasted good. There was a really nice atmosphere and if you want to watch sport there is a large screen.
"October 30, 2015",50,Great meal out,Wonderful atmosphere in a classic hard rock venue. Great food and drink. Would go back again. Enjoy the alcohol free cocktails!
"October 28, 2015",40,They have the nicer staff in NYC,"I like music and I was happy to see all the collection guitars, shoes, dresses, etc belonging to ""the very best"" They had even the Abbey road real doors !! The food is very good, really tasty, and the staff was very very nice."
"October 28, 2015",50,Great evening in easy surroundings,Been to several HRC and they never fail to satisfy. NYC Times Square Cafe is as good if not better than most. From the mayhem outside to a great atmosphere inside!
"October 28, 2015",40,Nice experience,"A little slow at the bar, but nice people doing a nice job! Centrally located in the heart of time square."
"October 28, 2015",50,Great Burger,"We were disappointed to find a queue at the Hard Rock Cafe and a half hour wait. We opted to take a seat at the bar and were able to eat there instead of waiting. Really great atmosphere and burger, very American!"
"October 28, 2015",50,"Great atmosphere, food and gift shop!","Very impressed with this store, they have everything you'd expect from a Hard Rock franchise, however is the people that works there that make it special, not over the top, just right. I had a great lunch there too."
"October 28, 2015",40,Good food but freezing cold inside,There is a lot of music memorabilia to look at. The food is good. However it is very cold inside and for us the music was far too loud.
"October 26, 2015",50,hard rock cafe as usual,"a MUST in new york! it's a nice place, a spectacular wall with only guitars. the food is the same as allover. so we entered only to the shop to buy some stuff."
"October 26, 2015",30,Just another Hard Rock Cafe,"There was nothing special about this HRC. Decent food and rock and roll atmosphere with lots of memorabilia. If you have never been to one then it is interesting but if you have been to any other one, nothing new here to see."
"October 26, 2015",30,Typical Hard Rock Tourist Trap,"Food is OK, but price, drinks are good but pricey. This is a Gard Rock Cafe, not too different tan others, pretty much exclusively for tourists or people that have not yer visited a Gard Rock Cagfe."
"October 26, 2015",40,Love The Atmospher,"Wow..just wow.. I went to 3 different hard rock cafe on my last trip.. and this HRC is the best. from the rock shop's collection, the atmospher, the location, the crwods, everything... The staffs also very helpful."

"October 26, 2015",30,"Good service, average food","The hard rock is overrated, I've been to a few and this wasn't anything spectacular. Crazy busy in this place, waited for 45 minutes for a table for two. Our server was great though as were most of the other waiters."
"October 25, 2015",50,Interesting,"Situated in bustling Times Square this is a very busy restaurant with pleasant and efficient staff, the food is good and the decor is brilliant. You could spend half an hour looking at the wall displays of music memorabilia. Well worth a visit."
"October 24, 2015",40,Nice restaurant,The food was ok. I ordered a hamburger well done and it was almost well done. The decor is nice. Staff was very professional and friendly.
"October 24, 2015",50,Great atmostphere,"I love the laid back atmosphere, with the rock and top 20's music blaring. The food is great and in a centralized location in Times Square."
"October 24, 2015",40,Hardrock review,"Good dining experience. Bit pricey but you expect that for- 1) the chain & 20) Its location. Good service, a little noisy but great for music memorabilia lovers. I myself spent little time at the table, preferring to look around"
"October 22, 2015",40,"""Great Visit to check out all the Musician's History of our Time & More""",We throughly enjoyed all the history of the Musician's of their time and to see all of the musical instruments right down to Billy Joel's motor bike. Friendly staff and well worth the visit if you are musically inclined.
"October 22, 2015",50,super experience,I love atmosphere and environment of this franchise. One of the best choises in NYC. Try their coctails.
"October 21, 2015",50,Friendly service to the end,Had a pre paid vochure which often creates a pronlem but not here! Fan time had b y us all! Well done!
"October 21, 2015",40,showing my age!!!,"Food good and plenty ,loved the burgers, staff cool and very busy ,but to me (only my opition)I found it a young persons place,very loud music, I should have expected this,showing my age,but go for it if you are young at heart and enjoy"
"October 20, 2015",50,An experience to share,"Whether you are alone, traveling as a couple or with friends you have to stop by this place as it is not only historical in nature but has fantastic service and huge menu that should satisfy anyone."
"October 19, 2015",50,Great Burgers!,"Typical Hard Rock fare, we love their burgers!, Also dessert is always a favorite. Chocolate Cake YUM!"
"October 17, 2015",50,10yrs@times.sq,"This is one of my two favorite Hard Rock cafes in the whole world. It is located at Times square, where its been for 10 years. This restaurant and its merchandise shop are always busy. Good vibes, good food, good service!"
"October 17, 2015",40,First Visit,Strange as it may seem this was my first visit to this chain it will not be my last. I'm not usually a fan of burgers but the ones here could certainly convert me. It was delicious! Look forward to my next visit
"October 14, 2015",50,Great place,"Great place for food, atmosphere and the service is fast. The price is a bit expensive but everything else is worth the detour"
"October 14, 2015",40,Fun!,"We had lunch here during our recent family trip to NYC. Kids and adults enjoyed the atmosphere a lot. Nice opportunity to get picture taken with kids holding guitars against ""guitar wall"". Food was good, but not great. Overall an enjoyable experience."
"October 14, 2015",30,Less than what expected!,It is similar to other franchise store all over the world except the abundance of security personnel everywhere. The bar was good and bar tenders are professional but not compare to other cool places all over NYC.
"October 13, 2015",20,"Don't bother, it's not good",Went for breakfast and it was not good. Both the food and service were not good at all unfortunately. There are many other far better places in the area to go to

"October 11, 2015",30,Expensive,"This restaurant was very costly for very average food and drinks. We couldn't finish our food as it was tasteless, I had the macaroni which was quite sickly."
"October 9, 2015",30,Average and Overpriced,Average food although Service was good. Had to wait for 30 minutes for a table but could have a drink at the bar. Drinks and food a little overpriced for what it is.
"October 8, 2015",30,Not worth the line,"The food here is average at best, on par with any chain restaurant the draw is the rock memorabilia. Very cool memorabilia on display, does not make up for over priced average food items. Kids menu provides nice coloring book/souvenir"
"October 7, 2015",40,A must try - original burger is outstanding,"Walking the area of Times Square renders hundreds of restaurants, but Hard Rock is a must try. Museum and surroundings gives you a great setting, food is good quality and prices are, considering the neighbour hood, reasonable. In addition good cocktails and nice desserts."
"October 7, 2015",50,Hard Rock Cafe Times Square,"Loved this place, from the memorabilia, to the staff and the food!! Bought quite a lot of stuff from the shop too as my kids collect their T Shirts from wherever they go."

"October 3, 2015",40,Hard Rock NYC,Obvious ambiance. Great server and friendly staff. Barbecue ribs were somewhat tasteless and not very meaty. Onion rings were a bit soggy.
"October 2, 2015",40,Always wanted to visit here...glad I did,"Great vibe love the theatre style of this place and music theme, bar staff a little officious asking for ID I wasn't flattered I found it annoying, I'm 50 for crying out loud Bit expensive for basically burger and chips"

"September 28, 2015",30,Pretty typical Hard Rock experience.,"Your typical Hard Rock. Overpriced drinks, loud music, and a crowd. It is generally what you would expect it to be."
"September 27, 2015",50,overall brilliant... like always,The food was excellent and the service great. Not to much noise and not to crowded. Will definitely go there again.
"September 27, 2015",40,good meal - busy place,This is a high energy and large HRC. No wait when we were there (lucky on that front). It's big and busy inside - fun - kids loved it. Food and service were both very good. Great experience.
"September 27, 2015",30,Breakfast Buffet was ok,"$17 per person for all you can eat buffet, food was ok, but not great. Service a bit slow but friendly. Central location by Time Square"
"September 25, 2015",40,"central location, food consistent","Like most Hard Rocks around the world, this is the same. You know what to expect!

"September 23, 2015",30,"Cool store, meal not worth the wait","We go to every Hard Rock when we travel. I'd go here if you collect trinkets, but elsewhere for a meal, especially in NYC"

"September 23, 2015",40,Hard rock cafe,Wanted a quick burger meal on way to a Broadway play down the street. Hard Rock Cafe was on the way so we went in. Got that burger in the bar area. Quicker service than the dining area.
"September 23, 2015",40,Not a Better View of Times Square,"Lunch at the Hard Rock Café on Times Square may not be unique and exciting, but it has predictably good food and the best seat in the house for Times Square."
"September 22, 2015",20,The Hard Rock is Not What it Used to Be.,A once reliable place to go for a decent meal at an okay price. This Times Square location has been a nightmare since it opened. How things have changed since the Hard Rock's 57th Street days and not for the better I'm sorry to say.
"September 22, 2015",50,NYCHRC!,"Another great Hard Rock Cafe'!!! This is a "" must stop"" when in NYC!!!! Great Time! The Ribs are to die for. The décor here is fabulous and the service is outstanding!!!"

"August 29, 2015",50,Love the place!,"Just in the middle of the square, where all the buzz is. You have to come and drink a hot chocklate when its cold out side. I loved the people there and the music as well."
"August 29, 2015",40,"Lovely food, but the air conditioning meant we felt it too cold to stay long","Another good restaurant to visit serving lovely food but this year we found it was very cold in the restaurant due to the air conditioning, which meant our food went cold very quickly."

"August 25, 2015",20,better for a family meal I think,"Some of the drinks don't have prices on them and we found out why when we got the bill, $17 for 1 average cocktail. We waited a long time for those drinks as well. Tasting platter was ok."

"August 15, 2015",30,Like all the other hard rocks,"It is exactly what you expect it to be, just like every other Hard Rock Cafe. The vibe is ok. The wait staff was fine. The food was average a bit over priced for a upscale burger joint"
"August 14, 2015",10,Terrible,"I have visited many Hard Rock restaurants before and I am not a big fan but this one top as one of the worst ones. The food and service were terrible. The cheeseburger is their ""main dish"" and it was edible. Not worth the visit."

"August 10, 2015",50,"Good food, long wait",I visited this establishment with my family. The wait was a bit long but once we were seated the service was amazing. I assume it's a tourist attraction so waiting comes with that.
"August 8, 2015",30,Great atmosphere NO PRICES DISPLAYED ON MENU,Always busy great place to soak up atmnosphere and good food but VERY DEAR . I have been a few times and loved it .
"August 8, 2015",30,No surprise,"Freezing cold in the room, waiting quite a long time for our burgers which were not so nice in the end. Cocktails were more icy than anything else expected... Food was not bad but not exciting!"

"August 5, 2015",50,Fun place,Loved it. Great atmosphere. And a Michael Jackson impersonator came out and entertained the crowd while we ate dinner. We like to hit the Hard Rock in every city we visit.
"August 2, 2015",50,Packed with punch,"A lively buzz began with our server and continued throughout the meal, a great location, noise, atmosphere and we were served efficiently and with charm. Photo opportunities abound and there is plenty on the menu to engage diners. This deserves return visits."
"August 1, 2015",40,Very busy but worth it.,"Though this is generally a tourist spot in any city, this store was enjoyable in its own right. Extremely busy, but you are able to sit at the bar and order off the full menu. I was in and out in about 30 minutes."

"July 25, 2015",40,Good for a break,The service was good and all the burgers come with french fries and sauce and they are very big. It's perfect for a little break for lunch and to spend some time with the family.
"July 22, 2015",50,Great food and fun for families,Took our teenage grandson to celebrate as part of his graduation trip to NYC. Great place to eat and interesting decor. Would definitely go here again
"July 20, 2015",50,Burgers with a bonus,We had a great dinner at the hard Rock and the lip sync by one of the waiters to lady Gaga was an added bonus! Our waitress was very attentive. My son loved his burger & the nachos were yummy too!
"July 19, 2015",10,Absolute awful,Over priced service is terrible. Breakfast was a shambles would rather of given my money to the tramps outside than to this awful rip off restaurant.
"July 17, 2015",30,overpriced,"very busy place with interesting rock decorations, we needed to que and wait for 15 min. the service was very basic, the food was overpriced.."
"July 16, 2015",30,I don't get it,"Why do so many tourists flock to this chain restaurant? With so many other places to visit in NY and better food to eat, why go here?"
"July 16, 2015",50,Good Food & Atmosphere,"Made to feel very welcome, Bar man was really helpful and professional. Food was excellent. Would return if in New York again."
"July 16, 2015",40,my favourite cafe,"I like this brand and it is always on a high level. Good interior,good food but prices are not cheap. Good american place"
"July 15, 2015",30,Nice atmosphere,The food is okay but the atmosphere is good. Nice photo opportunity area where you can take your own photo in front of Hard Rock background. The large guitar hanging over the stairway is neat.
"July 15, 2015",50,Great lunch in Times Square,"Right near center of Times Square, was told 25 min wait on a Sat afternoon, buzzer given and waiting area is big, buzzed in only 10 min. Air conditioning felt great on July day. Server very friendly, all our lunches were very good"
"July 15, 2015",20,Very Basic Breakfast,Went here for breakfast. Not much to say other than poor choice and quality of food (served in a buffet style) with an expensive price tag. The redeeming feature would be the building itself which was interesting to take a look around.
"July 14, 2015",40,Great steak and atmosphere,We were able find a seat at the bar right away. Bar tender was great. Food was cooked to order and the service was awesome.
"July 9, 2015",50,Music and Food - Fabulous!,The Hard Rock Cafe was a truly fabulous experience. The atmosphere was fun and the food was excellent. The wait staff were very friendly and attentive. I would highly recommend this venue.
"July 9, 2015",30,"Great atmosphere, average food","Just like any other Hard Rock Cafe around the world, you should firstly visit to see the memorabilia as there is always something that you will have never seen before. As for the food, I ordered the Legendary Bacon Cheeseburger and was disappointed."
"July 9, 2015",30,good food as usual - very poor service,"the place is as good as usual, the food is so good as usual, but what a deception about staff attitude, poor service, long service, so unusual over there. not good at all"
"July 9, 2015",40,Fun Experience - Food is Average,This is a good place to stop in and have a drink to see all the music memorabilia etc. There is much better food throughout the City however the location in Time Square is easy to find and get to walking.
"July 8, 2015",40,Great experience,"Good food, good service, lot's of interesting memorabilia to look at while you wait for a table. Been twice, would go again."
"July 8, 2015",40,"Nice food , great memorabilia, good experience","We visited the shop and since there were tables available we also have visited the restaurant. The food was great, the memorabilias were perfect and the staff very friendly. We loved it."
"July 7, 2015",40,Alright,"I was excited to visit Hard Rock in NY. The wait was not as long as I thought it would be. We were seated and the waiter came over fairly quickly, Food was delicious, friendly wait staff. Would go again."
"July 7, 2015",50,Waitting list worth it,"See the memorabilia, take a lot of pics, food is American what else cocktails great people all over world"
"July 5, 2015",30,MEH.,"Very Busy of course, service sucked but overall it was your normal experience for Hard Rock. Over priced, busy, poor service but atmosphere is always fun and entertaining!"
"July 4, 2015",50,Just awesome,"One of the best places to hangout in Time Square. Just order anything from the menu, it will be great. Do try nachos and Long island iced tea."
"July 3, 2015",40,Legendary,"Ambience of this place rocks. Wide variety of yummy cocktails. Just wish they had prices on the menu. Food ok. First place my hubby said of ""before we leave NY, I'm definitely coming here for a second visit """
"July 1, 2015",50,Appetizers,We were not very hungry so ordered just appetizers. Great service . Always tory to eat at a Hard Rock Café to see the décor.

"June 30, 2015",30,Good food,Great place for lunch. Hamburgers and salads delicious. Memorabilia is really interesting. Staff very efficient.
"June 29, 2015",40,"Standard experience, but no prices on the wine list","The food, service and ambience was the same as always. Good experience, exactly what we expected. However, the wine list had no prices. How can I decide what to order if I don't know what it is going to cost?"
"June 29, 2015",40,Good service and friendly staff in a great location,"Great location, staff in the restaurant where very friendly and polite, food was good. Food and drinks served promptly. Also very good atmosphere in the restaurant with lots of memorabilia on the walls. Highly recommended."
"June 27, 2015",30,Average,For Hard Rock Cafe the bar is really ok but with the burger we have been little disappointed especially as you know you pay more as its a Hard Rock Cafe. So go there if you like the atmosphere but not because of food.
"June 26, 2015",20,Average,"This place has nothing on the Orlando one. The low rating is justified. Food was average. Service was slow. Not her fault, she no doubt had heaps of tables to attend to."
"June 24, 2015",30,Average,"Had burgers from a speciality menu. They were of good quality, but dull. Have visited HRC in many countries and this place was below average."
"June 22, 2015",50,hard rock new york,good burgers good location . lots of rock and music items. excellent service set in an old theatre gets very busy.
"June 21, 2015",50,Always fun,"Always a great place to visit. Dinner, snacks, cocktails, atmosphere always hard to beat. And of course you have to pick up a pin or a t-shirt"
"June 20, 2015",10,"Food as expected, waiter in a bad mood",HRC NYC is large. Not crowded when we visited the place. Food was classic HRC as expected. Service was not. Our waiter had something to learn about being polite. There are better places to eat in NYC.
"June 20, 2015",50,Fab cocktails,"Cocktails really good each night we would finish off our day in Hard Rock Cafe, staff great and they make great cocktails ."
"June 18, 2015",20,So so,Very disappointed with this restaurant. Service was slow food very disappointing. Music far too loud. Fancy stuff around the walls but that's it. Avoid
"June 16, 2015",50,Yum,Every time I've been here it's always busy didn't have to wait too long at all thanks to the rain Great food great staff and visited gift shop too Would come back again
"June 13, 2015",30,"Luch, dinner yes, skip breakfast","We thought we'd have a good, hearty breakfast here, but it was just like any other bad motel buffet table. Price wasn't too bad $17, but it wasn't worth it."
"June 11, 2015",40,very good,"the concept is probably known to everyone, the food is excellent and the service friendly and proffesional, and you can see some ''relics'' from stars, it isnt the cheapest but for once it cant hurt"
"June 9, 2015",50,Usual standard,"Great place, lovely staff. Food was great. Had photo taken but was not asked to purchase it. Also visited for cocktails which are very impressive."
"June 8, 2015",40,Love it!!,"We felt like at home. The service was great all the time and I would like to make an special mention to Garfield, a good man with a fantastic sense of humor. Thanks Garfield!!"
"June 8, 2015",50,great food,great food great place and great staff went inside to chill before a flight and the staff could not have been nicer
"June 3, 2015",20,AMERICAN BURGERS,"Went to a wedding do there had burgers and a dreadful cheesecake there,poor service,was not busy,plastic covers,a half cooked burger with bacon and cheese ,not good,worst cheesecake ever,no cream or anything with a plain new york cheesecake."
"June 2, 2015",40,It's a Hard Rock Cafe!!,"Came in for lunch, it was busy but we were well taken care of and the food came quickly. Everything was great... It's a HRC and it does exactly what you expect from one."
"May 30, 2015",40,Good burger and great venue,"Large and interesting space, burgers were good, pleasant enough place to have a couple of beers. It felt like the chain it has become, reliable.... yes, but not quite as unique as it used to be. Would return though."
"May 27, 2015",20,Good for a quick bite,We stopped here for a quick meal before a show. Nice food but nothing special. Great location for a pre Broadway bite to eat.
"May 27, 2015",50,Excellent,a really nice way to close my first day @ ny really good food. really good staff. I had a very good time there..
"May 21, 2015",50,"Great service, great location","No matter how crowded the place is, you will get top quality food, and outstanding service. Fantastic location, right in the heart of Times Square."
"May 20, 2015",30,Same as the others,"Long wait, I like Hard Rocks but went because my daughter wanted too. With so many restaurants to choose from in NYC I would not choose again. Drinks and food were fine. You of course went through gift shop to get in ."
"May 19, 2015",50,Great,"I love it and I would definitely go there more than once. Good music, much space, not smoky, nice bathrooms. Prices fine and staff cool!"
"May 19, 2015",20,Very mediocre,Food was very average. Poor beer selection. The atmosphere pails in comparison to other hard rock cafes around the world. And the service? Absolutely shocking!!!!! 30 mins to place an order - 30 mins to get the first round of drinks. Shocking.
"May 22, 2015",50,Best layout of a Hard Rock ever!,"I sat here for 3 hours waiting on a friend to travel from Philadelphia, and it flew by. The staff were friendly, the bar is massive and the cocktails are perfect. I used the wifi and talked to fellow customers at the bar. Then we...More"
"May 22, 2015",20,"Deceitful selling, noisy but good food","Good food but otherwise I would avoid it.  The music in the restaurant (as in all the other HRCs I've visited) is way too loud. It is impossible to have a conversation and it is very uncomfortable to have a dinner there.  We were ""forced"" to buy two glasses. The waiter said that we can pick two glasses from the souvenir shop as we leave. The waiter made us believe the glasses were included but they were not, in the receipt there was a price for them. We were not asked if we wanted to buy the glasses, they were automatically added to the price! This we noticed after we had paid. And as we were not interested in the glasses in the first place, we actually forgot to take them from the souvenir shop.  The waiter also told to tick which tip we wanted to leave as if we wouldn't know how the tipping works (the options were 18% or 20%), i.e. they steer the customer to leave a specific amount of tip, even if the service is not worth it."
"May 21, 2015",50,"Great service, great location","No matter how crowded the place is, you will get top quality food, and outstanding service. Fantastic location, right in the heart of Times Square."
"May 20, 2015",30,Same as the others,"Long wait, I like Hard Rocks but went because my daughter wanted too. With so many restaurants to choose from in NYC I would not choose again. Drinks and food were fine. You of course went through gift shop to get in ."
"May 19, 2015",20,Very loud - hard to carry on conversation,We were here about 6pm. We did not have any trouble being seated as there was no line. I ordered the Salmon (22.95) and it was ok. My husband ordered the NY strip steak (29.95) and it was just average. Our server (Oscar) was good. The problem we had with this establishment was the noise. The music was too loud. It was very hard to carry on a conversation without yelling. This will not be on our return visit list.
"May 19, 2015",50,Great,"I love it and I would definitely go there more than once. Good music, much space, not smoky, nice bathrooms. Prices fine and staff cool!"
"May 19, 2015",30,Good quality but you can enjoy the museum more,"You 1st go and put your name on the waiting list (it is in time square so i guess it will be crowded all day), then you can go around checking the museum and take some nice photos. as for the restaurant staff are friendly food is good but too much calories :) we had the sampler appetizer and it has like 2000+ calories so we had to cancel our main courses ( we were 2 ). prices are fair compared to the location"
"May 19, 2015",20,Very mediocre,Food was very average. Poor beer selection. The atmosphere pails in comparison to other hard rock cafes around the world. And the service? Absolutely shocking!!!!! 30 mins to place an order - 30 mins to get the first round of drinks. Shocking.
"May 17, 2015",30,Good burgers shame about the service,"We have been to hard rock in every city we have visited and find that the food is always good, the burgers are my personal favourite, chicken or beef they are all excellent, my only issue here at Times Square is the service, hostesses are friendly, but bar service is shocking, waiting 20minutes for the miserable server to get to you, ordering food and not being asked for any sauces ect? Then having to shout one of the 4 bar tenders over who are busy having a chat for another drink, it's such a shame as the food and drink are actually really good once you get them.... We will be back to give it another go hopefully it will be better next time"
"May 17, 2015",50,"Delicious food, served in a fun and friendly setting","First, I want to state that this is a repeat review. I was at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City and it never disappoints me. Jeremy (or Jerome? My memory fails me sometimes) at the bar recognized me and took my order and served me a beverage quickly. For someone dining alone (or as a couple), the bar is a pleasant place to enjoy yourself. I can talk Hard Rock pins or food or New York events and be as comfortable as in my living room. I talked with several other people, each visiting from outside New York. One was from Kansas for company business in ""the City,"" and the other person was visiting from upstate a little bit; her journey, likely by train concluded with appetizers and a drink. I'm sorry I forgot your name exactly, but I've got to remember to say ""Happy Birthday"" and being recognized by another bartender and someone in the Rock Shop was great. Jose, it was interesting talking with you. I hope to connect with you again and continue the conversation."

"December 9, 2014",10,Go somewhere else,First time in New York and went here. Service was appalling and food even worse.... Our burger came up still frozen in the middle. Given a $25 gift card to say sorry but this can only be used on food

"September 2, 2014",10,Will not return,The service and food were extremely poor. They ran out of ice while we were there. Service was slow. Shake was a WASTE of money. Very little shake or alcohol. Hamburger was average tasting. Do not waste your time here.

"August 5, 2014",40,"Great food, Great atmosphere","One of the better Hard Rocks for an atmosphere, set under times square. Great food as usual, great service as usual and an all round really good dining experience just like every other hard rock!"

"August 5, 2014",40,Typical Hard Rock,Standard Hard Rock experience. Decent food and decor. Crowded but that is to be expected given it's in Times Square and it's summer in NYC. Great if your just looking for a good chain restaurant.
"August 3, 2014",30,Reasonably priced and convenient location,The food is what you would expect if you have been to a Hard Rock Cafe before. The service is good and you don't wait long for your meal to be delivered.

"July 23, 2014",40,Late Night Treat,Our family went here after a Broadway show. It was nearly midnight but the place was very busy and loud. Our teenagers had steak dinners and ate everything. My daughter and I just enjoyed appetizers. It was all good and the service great.
"July 23, 2014",40,"Great food, a bit noisy",We've eaten in Hard Rock Cafes in London & Florida. The food is pretty much standard (great quality). The New York restaurant is particularly noisy.

"July 11, 2014",40,Hard Rock Cafe Rocks,"What a fun atmosphere in Times Square! The food was good, but this place is more about the atmosphere. The waiters are fun and the restaurant is really cool! It is a must see if you are a music fan. Teenagers will LOVE it!!!"

"June 17, 2014",30,"Great Area, good food, good service","The best review was already given when the person said it is your typical Hard Rock. Nothing More, Nothing Less.

"April 15, 2014",40,"Great atmosphere, lovely bar",Always busy so may need to queue to get in. Therefore make sure you get there early and then have a few drinks at the bar before you eat. If you love rock music with your burgers you will love this place.
"April 9, 2014",40,It's Hard to top the Hard Rock,Really great food as usual. Very big restaurant and as you would expect it was very busy. However the staff were excellent and made us feel welcome
"April 5, 2014",10,Appalling food and terrible service,Hard rock fan so it was disappointing to be let down in what should be a flagship restaurant. On duty manager did respond well to our complaint so not all bad
"April 3, 2014",30,Distinctly Average,"Sorry to say, but the food was cold, service was slow, staff didn't seem interested, and it was over priced! Needless to say we won't be going back in a hurry."
"March 29, 2014",40,Great time even in lunch rush,"Enjoyable meal in a can't miss venue. Our server, Teddy, was very friendly and attentive. Greet staff perhaps not as friendly. Great menu."
"March 26, 2014",40,Your usual Hard Rock Cafe,This one is no different than the others which is not a bad thing. The food was great and our service was very good. We did have to wait a bit but you usually do at all Hard Rock Cafe's.
"March 24, 2014",40,Just like any other Hard Rock Cafe,"Food was good, staff were very helpful. The cocktails were lush! There is better restaurants to visit in the area but it was good!"
"March 23, 2014",30,Typical Hard Rock,"All the Hard Rock's I've been to are pretty much the same. We ordered the Jumbo Appetizer and it was good. Burgers are overpriced, but you are paying for the vibrant atmosphere."
"March 23, 2014",50,Great food!,Recently ate here three times during New York visit. Food is amazing but the que is really bad so book in advance. Watch out for the pushy blond German waitress who is very rude when she doesn't get the tip she wants!
"March 23, 2014",50,Rock n' Roll and nice food,"We got a table in front of Ringo Star Drums, the environmental is amazing, service very professional and the food is delicious."
"March 23, 2014",50,Ask for Harrys,"Went on a Saturday night and though the restaurant was packed, didn't wait excessively for a table. Had the greatest server named Harrys, great energy and very attentive. Would highly recommend, lots of fun."
"March 20, 2014",40,Great dynamics!,"Set in the heart of times square, you really get that ""buzz"" from all the hustling and bustling going on inside. Food was great, staff were very friendly, a bit busy but great fun!"
"March 10, 2014",40,Great Service-Good Food,"Had dinner at Hard Rock Cafe. The spinach Burger was delicious, Ambiance nice-Good service-Quick and very friendly."
"March 21, 2014",50,Tasty!,"We went expecting to have to wait but on both occasions we got a table very quickly.Staff were courteous and polite on greeting us and were shown to our table,provided with iced water and assigned a waitress.The service was quick and the food lovely,I had...More"
"March 21, 2014",40,Fun Place but Pricey!,"This is like all other Hard Rocks. You go for the scenery. The staff downstairs (where the restaurant is) are not friendly. It is almost like they are ticked you are there. In the past we have used our VIP card and have been seated in decent time, but we were told they have now done away with the cards. That was a lot of money I paid for the card which is now useless. The wait staff has always been friendly. They are helpful but they are really busy at all hours of the day. The food is medium. But again… remember you are really going for the scenery. Because we are aware of that… we have never had an unpleasant experience. It is just a fun place to go to say you have been there. It is a great place to people watch but don't expect to carry on a conversation. It is very loud too. Again though… remember where you are at. But for a fun place… try it!"
"March 20, 2014",10,Terrible,"Arrived in New York late afternoon and we were quite hungry saw The Hard Rock -awful The fries were child portions , hard and covered in black spots . None of the cocktails were priced and when we asked the Waitress she didn't know the prices! It was expensive and the only good thing we were served quickly which meant we could escape even quicker ! Claire & Joe London UK"
"March 20, 2014",40,Great dynamics!,"Set in the heart of times square, you really get that ""buzz"" from all the hustling and bustling going on inside. Food was great, staff were very friendly, a bit busy but great fun!"
"March 19, 2014",20,I can't believe it,"I am a massive fan of the Hard Rock Cafe, and have visited many over the years... However I was extremely disappointed with this one.  I can't believe I've had to give a poor review to this restaurant, but right from the time I entered the place, the staff were sooo rude... The girl who showed us to the seat had a right attitude, and basically threw the menus down on the table then disappeared off without saying a word to us... All other Hard Rocks I've been to the staff have been extremely friendly.. It's kind of the way the staff should be because it's such friendly atmosphere normally!  When the food came, if was cold and we hadn't even finished our jumbo combo when my very expensive and very cold steak turned up on my table!!!  I would say there are better places to eat in NYC for anyone who is thinking if going."
"March 18, 2014",50,Cheaper than expected!!,"We walked in and were told there was an approximate ten minute wait. We had our photo taken professionally and waited for about 4 minutes before being led to a table. The tables were at a comfortable distance apart and not squashed together, and the atmosphere is very rock and roll. I ordered chicken fajitas, the marinated chicken came on a bed of stir fried onions and peppers and the lettuce, cheese and wraps were all separate and for you to put together which was perfect for me being a fussy eater. For my chicken fajitas, a refillable soda drink and my share of the price for the professional photo we had taken it cost me $26."
"March 18, 2014",40,Great Experience,"Just had to go here as we went to the Hard Rock Cafe in Orlando last year and wanted to compare. Was seated just after a short wait. Slightly disappointed with my choice of dinner. The dish was described as twisted pasta that the waiter described as the twisted part being the very spicy sauce. Flavour great, looked superb but lacking in 'twist'. I was hoping for a good kick of chilli but it seems like the chef had just added one extra turn of the pepper mill. Would we go back again? Very much so, the atmosphere was great, the place was absolutely buzzing Other reviews have said the place was noisy, we call that being in New York!"
"March 13, 2014",50,Best Hard Rock I've visited,"I'm a frequent Hard Rock Cafe visitor & have been to a few around the world & go to the London Cafe a couple of times a year...  The Hard Rock Cafe New York just on Times Square is the best one I've visited. It was massive inside the restaurant with a lovely huge square bar you can sit around while you wait for your table. We only had a 10 minute wait, barely enough time to finish our cocktails! (I'm used to 30 minute waits in London at any given time). The decoration was gorgeous lovely colour changing lights hanging over the bar. Our server was lovely & accommodating. The portions were quite large (expected at any Hard Rock) and prices were reasonable (though it's not ""cheap""). We had the potato skins to start which were good, a burger & fajitas for mains, my fajitas were really good & there was so much I barely looked like I'd eaten anything when I'd finished! We were too full for deserts. The barman did a little flair performance to a Black Eyed Peas song which attracted a crowd & cheers & applause, but we couldn't see much from our table as the restaurant is nicely spread out. It was a great atmosphere, lovely, welcoming & friendly staff & great food. Highly recommend."
"March 12, 2014",20,Not worth it....,"Hard Rock Cafe. the icon of the nineties when we provincials all wanted to go there and the T shirts where proud possessions. Food is lousy, poor quality and cold on the plate. service is average. it is so large and crowded that the noise is impossible. cannot keep conversation at the table. not that we were eager to talk. hungry in, hungry out as nobody was able to finish their plate it was that bad."
"March 10, 2014",40,Great Service-Good Food,"Had dinner at Hard Rock Cafe. The spinach Burger was delicious, Ambiance nice-Good service-Quick and very friendly."
"March 5, 2014",50,Lovely Food,As always really enjoyed our visit to Hard Rock Cafe the meal and atmosphere were great the waiter was excellent !
"March 5, 2014",40,"Ok food, but excellent service","The food was ok, tipical of casual dinners. But the service was excellent, made us feel very welcomed. As for waiting time, it is times square so you probably going to have to wait. But in my experience i didn't have a long waiting time."
"February 28, 2014",40,Very good food.,Was sceptical before hand thinking this would be all show and no substance. How mistaken I was the starters were so huge we struggled to eat the main courses.
"February 16, 2014",50,Perfect experience,"After our dismal experience at Planet Hollywood we were slightly concerned about eating here... these were completely unfounded. It was great. Lovely staff, good atmosphere, great food and a truly NYC experience. Would go back again"
"February 16, 2014",40,Buffet Breakfast,"Called in on a very cold morning for a hot breakfast buffet. Fresh food, although not a huge choice, efficient service and certainly didn't feel rushed (although difficult to believe you ever would on a cold February morning.)"
"February 9, 2014",50,Yummy!,"As always the Hard Rock Cafe was nicely decorated. The bathrooms were clean! The food was delicious and there was plenty of it! However, don't ever order water unless you prefer drinking salty water. Yuk!"
"February 8, 2014",50,Didn't disappoint,"Every hard rock I've ever eaten in has had delicious food. We were not disappointed. Very busy place so go ahead of the dinner crowd, we got there around 5 and did not have to wait very long, 10 mins. Buy a tshirt."
"February 7, 2014",40,"Good food, great location",Good food at a reasonable price and a great location on Times Square. Music wasn't too loud which is a good thing if you ask me.
"February 7, 2014",40,Not bad!,"When you go to any Hard Rock Cafe, you expect a level of it being over commercial. The service, food and drinks however were good and the food was reasonably priced. We had to have a repeat visit as it was enjoyed so much."
"February 6, 2014",50,Fun fun fun,So many historic things to see and the staff were excellent. The food and drinks were amazing as well and we got a lot of food for our money.
"January 27, 2014",40,Enjoyable experience!,We arrived and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Once we were shown to our table the waitress was very friendly and service was good. The food and cocktails were good and all in all we had a good night out!
"January 21, 2014",50,Great Rock Burger!!!,Don't miss burger here if you are at ny. Good steak also!!!! And good music....great atmosphere...good location....great reputation...
"January 19, 2014",50,Finally got here!,"We have been to NYC a couple of times and kept meaning to eat at the Hard Rock, finally got here this time and wasn't disappointed. Food was great, staff were great, wait was about ten minutes which wasn't to bad."
"January 16, 2014",40,Good Food & Quick Service,There was a little wait for a table but worth it!! The food was yummy and the service was friendly and fast!!
"January 15, 2014",30,Food was okay - wouldn't return,"Standard fare... Although nothing in particular wrong with food, unless visiting for novelty value when in NYC eat elsewhere! Not the usual Hard Rock vibe"
"January 11, 2014",30,Food not good but very entertaining.,"Ordered the jumbo combo & a salad, the jumbo combo was colder than the salad. The bartender was very entertaining and all of the Hard Rock Cafe decorations were very nice."
"January 8, 2014",30,not worth the wait,good atmosphere but food very rushed and very average not worth the wait - tried 3 days to get in Plant Hollywood much better
"January 8, 2014",40,yum,"100% better than over the road at Planet Hollywood. Music better, food better, service better, everything better. Grabbed a bargain as well due to having 30% off at the time. Would love to visit again and stay longer"
"January 7, 2014",50,this place is the bomb,"I like this place the server was great wait was long and they were busy the food is great wife and family are French they are sticky about there food , are there words where great , so I loved my food"
"January 7, 2014",50,Excellent food,As in all Hard Rock Cafe the food is excellent. A bit of wait (unless you are a VIP member) but well worth the wait
"January 6, 2014",50,Never fail to disappoint,Both dined for breakfast and dinner........17dollars all u can eat buffet breakfast amazing......and for dinner the best steak I've eaten yes you may have to wait for a table but worth every mouthful highly recommended !!!!!

"December 30, 2013",40,As expected from a hard rock,The food Is great can't really go wrong as it's the same menu every where. Service was good but not great. It seamed to be a bit unorganised when you first arrive and are waiting to be seated.
"December 28, 2013",40,Well worth a visit,Iconic restaurant in an iconic area. Great food and friendly service and some interesting memorabilia in this New York branch. Loved the burger and enjoyed the ambience

"December 20, 2013",50,"Re-Visited, delicious","Once again the Hard Rock NYC did not disappoint, great food and extremely good service. Would recommend this for anyone visiting New York."
"December 16, 2013",30,Disappointed,Very disappointed this time round - food came out freezing cold (twice) both the starter and the mains Hopefully was just a blip as have eaten at other hard rock cafés and never had an issue before the food is normally good!
"December 16, 2013",50,"Quick Service, Good Food",We had an early dinner and was able to get immediate sitting at the bar. Staff was friendly and attentive. Pricing was fair based on where we are. I would definitely come back!
"December 14, 2013",20,Waste of time (and lots of it),"Went with our three kids. Waited in line for about forty five minutes. When we finally made it in, service was so-so. Food was more greasy and diner-level. All in all - would not go again, in spite of the nice decor and atmosphere."
"December 10, 2013",30,Good fun,"Went one evening, was fairly busy and a fun, upbeat atmosphere. Love all the memorabilia and music. Food was ok and the service not too bad, it was pretty busy but the waiter was good fun."
"December 9, 2013",40,Always great experience,We waited a little bit (20 minutes) but leveraged the opportuntiy to have a coktail at the bar (great Mojito :-)) and then we enjoyed a nice burger with great music and great R&R items to look at.
