"July 17, 2017",50,Superb meal in relaxed surroundings,"Not cheap, but I knew that from the four £££ signs! But worth every penny. Best seating is outside, at the back of the restaurant (when the weather permits). My steak was excellent, and I never felt rushed by the attentive staff."

"April 11, 2017",30,Pip is great; the food is mediocre,"One of the friendliest bartenders in Munich -without a doubt! However, if you want a great steak visit Little London. El Gaucho makes a decent Caesar salad - maybe they should consider going vegetarian."

"December 2, 2014",30,"Excellent food, improvable organization, unpleasant waiter.","Reservation done three weeks before the due date as a medium sized group of people were attending. Reservation missing, luckily we had e-mail evidence. The manager literally stole the phone by my hands and went somewhere to show the e-mail to someone else... The table...More"
"November 21, 2014",30,Ok - but room to improve,Really nice interior and by the looks you expect to get the very best of meat. Sadly my visit was only mediocre if that. I ordered a t-bone steak medium - and what I got was a medium ++. And if you are supposed to be a beef restaurant that really isn't good enough. Service was also quite bafling - the waiter I had first was very friendly but the one bringing the food was only interested asking if everything was ok - never waiting for the answer.... Not cheap either - 100€ for one person.
"November 18, 2014",50,The best steakhouse in town,Used to live in Munich and this upscale restaurant is the best Argentinian steakhouse in town... And I have been in many steakhouses ;-) Perfect service Quality meat and fabulous wine selection. Different steaks are presented and explained in a glass window at the table so that the choice is easier ;-) Had the fillet with a bottle of merlot and a soup. All extremely tasty. Would definitely go again.
"November 18, 2014",40,Another Steak-Gem in the heart of Munich,"Located centrally right on the edge of the Viktualienmarkt, El Gaucho is the latest addition to the great line up of Steak-Restaurant in Munich. The scene of cow devouring gourmets will be delighted since this restaurant can certainly go eye to eye with well established locations such as The Grill or Goldene Kalb (just around the corner). Not sure if it hits the brilliance of Shane's but I've only been once so we shall see. The prices are fair and the wines are excellent. I'd love to see yet a larger menu of whines from Südsteiermark but that's my personal preference."
"November 12, 2014",50,An extraordinarily accomplished restaurant that's only been open a few weeks,"Unusually I chose this restaurant on instinct rather than from reviews on TA. And boy did I get it right! Close to the centre of town it was for a business dinner with a mix of Scots, Moldavians and English. So what better than a Steakhouse? Well this place is a lot better than your average Steakhouse. The service is attentive without pressing, the menu is clear and the staff know it backwards. The wine list has something for all tastes. So what did we have? Well all of us went for the Ribeye medium rare with ranch fries and we were split on having a side Cesar's salad but the 300g steaks were absolutely fantastic, well aged and perfectly cooked. The fries were some of the best I have ever had including Heston's own triple cooked specials. We went for the apple pie or the chocolate desert which again came up trumps. Now wine. A Barolo (actually 2) was imbibed - expensive but worth every penny, followed by a rather nice ice wine with desert.  we were the last out and there was no pressure to leave and they ordered taxis for all of us.  Going back? Damn right I am"
"November 6, 2014",50,What a great stumble!,"Wondering around Munich to find a nice restaurant we stumble across El Gaucho. It looks classy from the outside and lives up to it's good looks! The service was charming aided with complimentary bread to start. The mains were delicious, I could have eaten it all again so brought friends here a few weeks later! The wine choice was fantastic and the eye catching wine store wasn't bad either (see pictures). This restaurant comes highly recommended. Book in advance."
"October 30, 2014",50,Great food!,"This place was amazing! We had the porter house steak, some sides and wine. Would definitely recommend! You will want to make a reservation though."
"October 28, 2014",30,Good steakhouse !,"Good beef, but not the best I have tasted .... ordered a Sirloin. We were there for a business dinner. I wasnt so pleased with the service ! We had to wait 10 minutes over our reservation time. And the servant we got, didnt smile."
"October 25, 2014",40,Delicious Steakhouse,"I would have not walked in this place as I am a Vegetarian but this was a place that caught my father's attention. We did not have a reservation but came by early enough to beat the rush. The host graciously accommodated us although we were placed at the far back table.  The staff all spoke English so it was easy for us to maneuver the menu. Unfortunately, my father had to send his steak back as it was under cooked. The chef did not just re-cook but provided a new steak. I expect this, but my father did not and was pleasantly surprised.  I had the pumpkin risotto that was recommended by the waiter. I can see as squash was apparently in season as I saw it all over the market. I enjoyed it but was not wowed.  Overall, the service, quality of food, and wine was very good. I would recommend to someone who enjoys a good steak."
"February 8, 2020",50,amazing restaurant,"It was a little hard to get a reservation, but when you get there you will understand why. Overall, great."
"January 5, 2020",40,Great meats,"This is a meat place. Don’t go here if you are not a meat lover. Make a reservation because it does get busy. We had some wonderful steaks and ribs. Properly cooked, full of flavour. Service is a bit ‘rustic’ but works just fine"

"May 26, 2018",50,Best meal i had in Munich,Rusticana is something in between a restaurant and a bar and they offer great food and we loved every bite of it. The meat was tender and was just right. The spare ribs are probably one of the best I ever had.
"May 25, 2018",50,Best spare ribs I ever had,The ribs in this place are amazing. The bbq sauce is incredible (doesn't taste too smoky) and it is perfect with the meat. I really recommend this place if you are in Munich but be aware that you have to book a table in advance.
"May 16, 2018",50,Early dinner and great local place,This place was recommend by a friend that live in the city. We went for a local dish without a reservation but since we came early they managed to get us before a reservation. You must try the ribs with weissbier 😉

"February 18, 2017",40,Small but good!,A very small restaurant and that's why it is very difficult to find a table. We had a great goulash soup and then good ribs (maybe too much bbq sauce on it). Great keller beer and snaps!

"January 18, 2012",50,Very busy little place with really good BBQ ribs,Based on others reviews of this restaurant I persuaded some colleagues to take the long taxi ride across town from our hotel to check this restaurant out.  As with all restaurants in Munich its important to prebook tables as they are very busy. We arrived 10 mins early and our table was still in use and so we were asked to wait on a smaller table until ours was ready. There was a constant stream of people arriving and the waitresses did there best to shuffle people into any gaps they could find.  The beer and food was excellent. 4 of our party ordered ribs and they came all together on a large sharing platter a couple of feet wide and half a foot high. It was a struggle but we just about managed to eat them all.  Everyone having ribs was given a paper bib to keep the muck off your clothes. And they were served with your choice of jacket potato with sour cream of crunchy salad (of a very good size).  We also had people ordering steaks and onion rings amongst all of which were very well received by the other people in my group. Food and ambiance was certainly worth the trip. I'll be adding it to my regular eating places when traveling back to Munich in the future.  Fillet steak was on the menu but €30 for 250g. Rump steak was more affordable.
"December 23, 2011",50,Great ribs,"We had the barbecued ribs and steak and enjoyed them very much. Tender, spicy, and delicious. We found the place by accident and got the last two seats in the place, recommend reservations as the place just isn't that big. The prices were fair for the amount and quality of the tasty food. Meat lovers paradise, vegetarians beware!!"
"November 6, 2011",50,"Excellent pork ribs, and plentiful","Service was friendly and the food was very good. The main dishes are strictly beef steak and pork ribs, but they have good side salads, beers, and a full bar.  Reservations are important, as they get pretty full. You can make them by telephone or at the website."
"October 16, 2011",50,Post marathon dinner,"we ate here after the 2011 Munich marathon, frankly it was great. not the most sophisticated place but great food and great friendly service to a hungry runner and his family. we got there at 5.30 and by 6pm it was packed. i suggest to anyone going that they book, it too good to miss and a little out of the way from down-town Munich to risk disappointment. Don't good for a stylish meal with a fancy meal menu and wine list to match, but for the best ribs in town washed down with local larger its not to be seconded"
"October 15, 2011",40,The carnivore choice,"Very easy to park in the street nearby. Small place – about 7 tables. Ordered spareribs and steak. Ribs dish was big and generous. The down side was that they were coated and soaked with heavy barbeque sauce just after they were taken from the grill and before they were served to the table, it affected the taste and our satisfaction. If you want ribs"" American style"" – why go to Munich? go to the US…. Would recommend asking to get the ribs with the sauce on the side Steak was excellent. Prices were fair"
"September 29, 2011",50,Best American-style BBQ in Munich,"After much searching, we found Rusticana to be the closest thing to American BBQ or even American food in general, in all of Munich. The location is great (few minutes walk from Ostbahnhof), the food is amazing and the prices are reasonable. Order the ribs, put on a bib and get ready for the meat sweats!"
"June 30, 2011",40,Cozy Restaurant with Excellent Food,"I find myself torn when visiting this restaurant. The steaks are great, the staff is friendly, and the presentation is wonderful. The restaurant also has menus in multiple languages. The drink menu is extensive and most food is of a grilled variety, with the primary options of steak or ribs. However, the service sometimes leaves something to be desired.  While the restaurant claims to be famous for the ribs, their steaks are significantly better than their ribs in terms of flavor. The house sauce they recommend with the steaks, which cost an additional 2.50, is a spicy flavor which I've never cared for. Instead, I recommend you also try the mushrooms with your steak. Always perfect and fresh.  The staff is very friendly and always tries their best to be personal and accomidating. As with many restaurants in Munich, the service is often very slow. Expect 10-15 minutes for a second beer to arrive once you've ordered it so ask in advanace. A typical bill runs around 50 Euro a person.  Where I have the most trouble is the reservation windows. They give you a 90 minute reservation window to arrive, order, and eat, which I've often waited 30 minutes to be seated, another 15 minutes to complete an order, 30 minutes for the food to arrive, and then be constantly reminded that someone else has reserved the table I am seated in the 15 minutes remaining. You can forget desert if they are rushing you, as that takes another half hour minimum. If it wasn't for this attitude, I wouldn't have a single complaint.  Either way, I recommend you try it once and decide for yourself. I've never had a bad meal here. You must get reservations to eat here, as it is always extremely busy. Outdoor seating is also available."
"February 2, 2011",50,Best steaks in Munich,"Rusticana is our favorite place to eat steaks in Munich - we have tried several steak houses around here, but nothing compares. Steaks are big and very tasty and come with a variety of side dishes. My boyfriend (being Latin American) has very high standards on meat quality and this is the only place he endorsed. Their spare ribs are also very yummy. We usually share some spare ribs as a starter and then continue with more meat :-). I am not sure about their deserts, we are usually too full to eat any. Prices are comparable to any other steak house in Munich, not cheap but that's what it costs around here. I recommend timely reservation, place is fairly small and busy. It can also get loud and cramped, so beware."
"December 12, 2019",50,Excellent Steak Meal,This is a great place to eat meat and enjoy your friends company. Good service excellent quality meat. Try it

Very happy. Then we decided to go again now. Food was delivered after 40minutes waiting time, not together for all...More"
"March 14, 2016",50,Best steak in town,I have been to several Block House restaurants in Europe and all o can say is that the food standards of the meat are very high. I really enjoyed the T Bon steak cause it was large and juicy and also we had a very good rib eye steak. Salsa need to be a bit more tasty in general but the desert was also very good. We had the tiramisu the strudel and the very tasty cheesecake. Prices were very reasonable and the service also very good.
"February 6, 2016",40,"Tasty, enough, but the beer was not the best!","It was very tasty, enough, but the Radler was not as I expected! No need reservation, even if it's Saturday evening! The prices are a little bit expensive! Try it, it deserve to see how it is! Enjoy your meal!"

"December 18, 2015",40,My favorite steak house in MUC,"I've been many times to the Munich Block House. They do really good steaks on a constant high quality level for many years now.  My favourite is the rib eye steak, some times they even have daily specials i.e. Bone-in Rib Eye.  If you plan to go there take some time. You cannot make a reservation and there are usually already several people waiting to get a table."
"November 20, 2015",20,Not consistent,You expect from a steak house to know better than anyone how to cook a steak! This is not the case with this restaurant. We ordered one steak well done and another rare. They brought us both steaks well done. We had to wait for 20 min to bring us another well done steak instead of rare! Twice the mistake?
"November 14, 2015",10,Average lunch for which we waited for one hour,"I got very disappointed when eating here. We ordered soup which we received in less than ten minutes and then had to wait for more than one hour for the main dish, despite us asking the waitress two times if she forgot that we also ordered a main dish. The dish was average, but the prices are average as well, very greasy and with a lot of sauce. Looking back, I should have chosen a McDonald's hamburger, it would have tasted the same, without me waiting such a long time. Many people who arrived after us received their dishes before we did and the restaurant was half empty."

"September 29, 2014",40,"If you want a steak, dont doubt it","If you are having steak hunger don't hesitate to go, the meat is really good.
