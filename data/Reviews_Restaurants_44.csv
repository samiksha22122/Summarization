16 October 2016,50,"This ""concept"" restaurant is world class","We were in London for 5 days, we ate there twice. It is only for beef-eaters, but is excellent. Not a lot of variety on the menu, but you cannot beat the price or the quality."

30 September 2016,50,Fantastic Lunch,We visited this restaurant on a Saturday for lunch and I was blown away by the hole experience. The menu is simple but the food was excellent. The flat iron cut of steak was great. I would recommend this restaurant.
3 October 2016,40,Amazing food and great value,"It was our first visit here and at first the menu was a bit limited, but once it was explained you get the understanding in how the restaurant works. There was no appetisers available, but there water and beef flavoured popcorn on the table when...More"
2 October 2016,40,Very friendly staff and delicious burgers,"First time there with my family. We all had a great time. We ordered one steak for my two children (7 & 5 years old) while my wife and I ordered burger each, which was so delicious.  The waiter was super friendly: he was the one who suggested the steak for the children and they really liked it a lot, he was so funny, easy going, helpful, patient and service oriented ( pity a can't remember his name).  Good value for money, I think we paid around 50ish the 4 of us. We also took a couple of cocktails and soft drinks for the children.  They have a nice ice cream station at the entrance of the restaurant but unfortunately they only have one flavor which I think is salted caramel or something of the like.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and might consider going again but you know London has too many options to stick to only one."
1 October 2016,50,Best Meal We had in London,"I brought my 12 year old son to London for his birthday, and he really wanted STEAK! So we searched for a good steakhouse, and tried Flat Iron. It was THE BEST decision! My son LOVED his steak, as did I. We were told it would be an hour wait initially, but when they saw I had a 12 year old, they seated us immediately! We had a lively dinner and enjoyed our after dinner ice-cream, as well. It made for the perfect birthday dinner for my son! Thanks Flat Iron!"
1 October 2016,30,Bleh,"Visited this restaurant with a friend and firstly I must say didn't pre-book (I don't believe that you can) The restaurant was incredibly busy which I would take to be a good sign and we were quickly shown seats at the back of the restaurant (all good so far).  The menu is pretty basic and you need to remember when ordering that its the sort of place where you need to order sides separately. I ordered the steak (well was the point in going) as did my friend along with two side orders of chips.  The drinks menu doesn't have any main brand drinks only ""alternative"" such as dandelion and burdock etc. personally I would prefer a cola (doesn't need to be branded just any cola) but this is my personal opinion.  The cutlery is a normal knife and a mini cleaver (not really required). the steak came pre cut into slices and was alright, not best steakl I've had but far from the worst. The chips however where somewhat greasy, they are advertised as cooked in dripping which I have no issue with but just didn't taste right with the meal.  Until it was time to leave the service had been prompt but once finished it took a long time to get the bill and I didn't realise till afterwards there was a ""voluntary"" donation to charity included within this along with service charge which i hate.  The charity part of the bill was not explained to me which would have been nice.  I'm going to say that this is solely my personal opinion on the venue and I won't be back but from reviews most people like the place."
30 September 2016,50,Great lunch,"Our son who lives and works in London recommended this restaurant and are we glad he did. Everything was great. Food, service, atmosphere. The creamed spinach was lovely and the steak was cooked to perfection. Free ice cream with the meal was gorgeous too. Really excellent value. Will visit again when we're back in the capital."
30 September 2016,50,Fantastic Lunch,We visited this restaurant on a Saturday for lunch and I was blown away by the hole experience. The menu is simple but the food was excellent. The flat iron cut of steak was great. I would recommend this restaurant.
30 September 2016,50,Best Steak EVER,"Wow! Wow! Wow! The flat iron steak was so incredible juicy and tender that we couldn't believe it was a piece of meat. Perfection. Our 7 year old boy was also very impressed and asked us multiple times during our stay in London if we could eat at ""the steak restaurant"" once again."
30 September 2016,50,Well worth a visit! Or a return visit!,"We got here at 6pm last night and needed to eat before a show starting at 7.30pm. There was a small queue outside and we were worried about a long wait. As there was only two of us we didn't need to wait more than five minutes although we had been told it may be 15-20 mins so that was great. We were taken to a table and given a carafe of water and some glasses and a little tub of free popcorn while we looked at the menu. Waiter was really lovely and explained what was available and we both ordered the steaks medium rare and some white wine and two sides - chips and the aubergine dish as well as some sauces for the steak. We didn't have to wait long for our meal which tasted divine! All of it! Salad that came with the steak a decent size and had a tasty dressing. After we paid the bill we were given two tokens for us to get ice creams- salted caramel dipped in chocolate shavings on the way out. Would definitely return here! Bill came to ¬£46 odd. Food great value, wine was ¬£8 a glass so perhaps on high side but for London I think is pretty standard. Wine was very nice!"
30 September 2016,50,Amazing restaurant,"This was our first visit to Flat Iron and we loved it. We arrived at about 7 and were told no tables until about 9. They took our mobile number and sent a text when the table was ready, what a great idea.  The food was a choice of steak or steak which is why we choose the restaurant in the first place. The sides were plentiful and not expensive.  The staff were friendly and helpful. Great value for money.  We will be visiting here again."
29 September 2016,50,Pre birthday dinner,After a short wait outside we were told it would be an hour wait. The hostess put us at ease by asking for my phone number and encouraged us to seek a drink next door and we would receive a text when our table was ready. Within 45 minutes we received a text and we made our way to Flat Iron. We were seated on a shared table and my boyfriend expressed that he would prefer a different table. Upon this our server Luigi was right onto it and gave us the best seat in the house. The atmosphere was lively yet relaxed. Luigi explained the menu really well and recommended the Malbec which was beautiful at ¬£22.50 The steak was tender and tasty cooked medium rare. Luigi threw the chips and ice cream in for free and for a birthday meal coming in at under ¬£50 we couldn't have got a better experience at other well known steak restaurants in London.  Well worth the wait :)
29 September 2016,50,Excellent Meat,"At London scenario, Flat Iron have on of best offers of meat for a very good price. The sides ate very tasty as well. You can have a very good meal for less than 15 pounds."

16 September 2016,40,Decent,"I had been to Flat Iron before albeit not this branch. I think what makes this branch special is the fact that you get a free ice cream at the end of your meal, which is great...if you like salted caramel."
14 September 2016,50,Little gem in Covent Garden,"Found this steak restaurant by chance. Fantastic food, atmosphere and staff. Lots of unexpected touches including beef dripping popcorn and a token for ice cream. Highly recommend üòÄ"

9 December 2015,50,"The biggest, brashest and best Flat Iron by far","I enjoyed a visit to Flat Iron's (second) Denmark Street branch about a year ago. I liked the New York style concept of slices of Flat Iron steak (known as Butler's steak in the UK) for a tenner served on a platter, garnished with a little pot of spring greens, cut with a small square-shaped cleaver. Add chips or creamy spinach for ¬£2.50 or ¬£3.00 respectively. All dishes preceded by a complimentary pot of popcorn. Alternatively try a different cut of beef or even a Wagyu steak burger. The only drawback was the rather poky nature of the interior with no more than 30-40 seats, hence difficult to get a seat at peak times. 17-18 Henrietta Street is an altogether different proposition. The menu is largely the same, but the premises, in what for many years housed Porter's Old English Pie House, are on an altogether grander sale, with room for up to 200 diners, a butchery displaying at least three huge carcasses of beef, but also a table where caramel is crunched to sit atop complimentary ice creams offered at a meal's end. Today I was offered two alternatives to the standard flatiron steak, one of which, a rump cut, I chose. On top of its ¬£12.50 price tag my side orders of chips, creamy spinach and a silky smooth bearnaise sauce, added another ¬£6.50 to the bill. Wines are served by the large glass, carafe and bottle. There are a few interesting bottled craft beers, but I chose the Yorkshire beer on tap. For some reason Flat Iron doesn't do coffee, but I left satisfied with my complimentary ice cream."

9 December 2015,50,"The biggest, brashest and best Flat Iron by far","I enjoyed a visit to Flat Iron's (second) Denmark Street branch about a year ago. I liked the New York style concept of slices of Flat Iron steak (known as Butler's steak in the UK) for a tenner served on a platter, garnished with a little pot of spring greens, cut with a small square-shaped cleaver. Add chips or creamy spinach for ¬£2.50 or ¬£3.00 respectively. All dishes preceded by a complimentary pot of popcorn. Alternatively try a different cut of beef or even a Wagyu steak burger. The only drawback was the rather poky nature of the interior with no more than 30-40 seats, hence difficult to get a seat at peak times. 17-18 Henrietta Street is an altogether different proposition. The menu is largely the same, but the premises, in what for many years housed Porter's Old English Pie House, are on an altogether grander sale, with room for up to 200 diners, a butchery displaying at least three huge carcasses of beef, but also a table where caramel is crunched to sit atop complimentary ice creams offered at a meal's end.
