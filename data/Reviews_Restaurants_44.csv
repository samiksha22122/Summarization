18 July 2019,40,英法美食之旅（6）：Flat Iron,"講到倫敦鋸扒，又平又抵食既非Flat Iron 莫屬。這間店以£10 一份牛扒做賣點（現在加了£11). Flat Iron 在倫敦有幾間分店。但只有一間有得上網訂位（請自行上官網查）。其他分店都係即場排隊的。今次我去既係Covent Garden 分店。我大約下午2點鐘去食，不見人龍，好快有得坐。侍應會奉上鹽味爆谷做小食。這裡選擇唔多，只有Flat Iron Steak 同埋Special Beef (Rib Eye). 牛係用英國牛，佢的狀態、肉味如何都會有塊板寫晒出來。當日想食的Rib Eye 無晒唯有食Flat Iron Steak, medium rare 配peppercorn sauce 。免費配菜只有菠菜沙律。其他的side dish 包括薯條同忌廉菠菜及醬汁全部都需要另外加錢。 牛扒上桌時已經幫你切好晒。Medium Rare 剛剛好，唔會太韌。肉味算濃郁，夠Juicy. 不過把刀就唔夠user friendly. 比較難切。（在倫敦去了幾間鋸扒的地方，把刀都係無鋸齒的，把刀唔夠鋒利，比較難切肉🤷🏽‍♂️）。忌廉菠菜都做得唔錯。總括來，£11的牛扒有這樣的質數真係好抵食。 食完之後埋單個陣個侍應會俾把刀仔飾物你。這把刀仔是用來換免費雪糕的。雪糕自家製。只有一種味（朱古力味）配朱古力碎。 兩個人加埋大約~£35左右。圍埋HKD 400都唔使，又好食，又有甜品送。性價比在倫敦來說是極高！抵佢咁多人推薦。"
17 July 2019,40,"Nice , For a quick fix","Cute place, good for kids. The burgher and the beef dishes are good . note enough choice . Fries and sauces are good too ., fun place. nice presentation . overall nice experience. Prices are very reasonable ."

13 February 2017,40,For the money great value,The steak is great for the money a nice touch with the ice cream after. It's not a new idea (Le Relaise De Venice) do something similar but they do it very well and it's cheaper. Can't fault it

18 January 2017,50,Great stuff,"We visited late on a Wednesday night about 9.30pm so not much of a wait (about 15 mins) and wasn't too busy inside. We loved the steak, wines and sides. The salted caramel ice cream just tops the whole thing off, even in January!"
18 January 2017,40,Good Food - but a long wait to sit down,Always good foo - but they do cram you in there. The wait is long and they rush you through. Not much privacy but if you don't mind that and only come for the steaks then you will love it. Good price as well.
17 January 2017,50,Nice steak!,"The flat iron steak is tender and tasty. The burger is also a great option, tender and juicy, but since it's a special they only have it in certain days."
17 January 2017,50,Mouth watering,Absolutely love it! Normally plan our weekends in London around this place! Simple easy menu and steak cooked to perfection just melts in your mouth! Only down side is the wait for a table but we usually go around 3pm so it isn't rush hour!

12 January 2017,30,Too small steak,Good atmosphere but the food wasn't as expected. The steak was cold and wasn't fresh. They add a lot of ice in drinks. About 75% of the drink was ice.
8 January 2017,50,Great Steak. Excellent Price.,Best steak in London for under £15 with a side. Easily comes close to the more expensive restaurants of Goodman and Hawksmoor at fraction of the price.

22 December 2016,40,Good food on poor plates,"It's pretty good here. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides delicious, particularly the aubergine. The only negative is the wooden plates smelt strongly of dishwater with a hint of washing liquid which is off putting."
21 December 2016,40,Enjoyable experience,"The steak was lovely, the sides fresh and tasty, the service was friendly and attentive. Only two steaks on the menu but that's really all you need."

13 December 2016,50,"Excellent, CP值很高!","I ordered a flat iron steak and dripping chips batch. The taste of steak was really delicious, though the chips was a little bit oily. Nice place with good atmosphere. 雖給滿分還是要講不足的地方~招牌牛排味道真的還不錯，肉質也有嚼勁，不過份量對於男生可能略少。附贈的沙拉還可以，加點的薯條有點油。店內燈光氣氛好，但人太多有點吵雜。 總的來說，在倫敦市區僅僅10鎊的價錢能有這樣的質量算非常不錯!"
11 December 2016,50,"Great steak, great ice cream","We had to wait for 90 minutes, but it's worth it. The steak was good and the price is quiet reasonable. I did not like their salad and sides (neither the broccoli nor the fries). The free ice cream you got is really really delicious."

16 October 2016,50,"This ""concept"" restaurant is world class","We were in London for 5 days, we ate there twice. It is only for beef-eaters, but is excellent. Not a lot of variety on the menu, but you cannot beat the price or the quality."
16 October 2016,50,Well worth the wait,Fantastic Saturday spent working our way through the specials and sides at Flat Iron. All food to a fantastic standard. Kind and helpful staff made sure we were able to make our way through the cocktail menu whilst we waited... a very happy evening!

30 September 2016,50,Fantastic Lunch,We visited this restaurant on a Saturday for lunch and I was blown away by the hole experience. The menu is simple but the food was excellent. The flat iron cut of steak was great. I would recommend this restaurant.
3 October 2016,40,Amazing food and great value,"It was our first visit here and at first the menu was a bit limited, but once it was explained you get the understanding in how the restaurant works. There was no appetisers available, but there water and beef flavoured popcorn on the table when...More"
2 October 2016,40,Very friendly staff and delicious burgers,"First time there with my family. We all had a great time. We ordered one steak for my two children (7 & 5 years old) while my wife and I ordered burger each, which was so delicious.  The waiter was super friendly: he was the one who suggested the steak for the children and they really liked it a lot, he was so funny, easy going, helpful, patient and service oriented ( pity a can't remember his name).  Good value for money, I think we paid around 50ish the 4 of us. We also took a couple of cocktails and soft drinks for the children.  They have a nice ice cream station at the entrance of the restaurant but unfortunately they only have one flavor which I think is salted caramel or something of the like.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and might consider going again but you know London has too many options to stick to only one."
1 October 2016,50,Best Meal We had in London,"I brought my 12 year old son to London for his birthday, and he really wanted STEAK! So we searched for a good steakhouse, and tried Flat Iron. It was THE BEST decision! My son LOVED his steak, as did I. We were told it would be an hour wait initially, but when they saw I had a 12 year old, they seated us immediately! We had a lively dinner and enjoyed our after dinner ice-cream, as well. It made for the perfect birthday dinner for my son! Thanks Flat Iron!"
1 October 2016,30,Bleh,"Visited this restaurant with a friend and firstly I must say didn't pre-book (I don't believe that you can) The restaurant was incredibly busy which I would take to be a good sign and we were quickly shown seats at the back of the restaurant (all good so far).  The menu is pretty basic and you need to remember when ordering that its the sort of place where you need to order sides separately. I ordered the steak (well was the point in going) as did my friend along with two side orders of chips.  The drinks menu doesn't have any main brand drinks only ""alternative"" such as dandelion and burdock etc. personally I would prefer a cola (doesn't need to be branded just any cola) but this is my personal opinion.  The cutlery is a normal knife and a mini cleaver (not really required). the steak came pre cut into slices and was alright, not best steakl I've had but far from the worst. The chips however where somewhat greasy, they are advertised as cooked in dripping which I have no issue with but just didn't taste right with the meal.  Until it was time to leave the service had been prompt but once finished it took a long time to get the bill and I didn't realise till afterwards there was a ""voluntary"" donation to charity included within this along with service charge which i hate.  The charity part of the bill was not explained to me which would have been nice.  I'm going to say that this is solely my personal opinion on the venue and I won't be back but from reviews most people like the place."
30 September 2016,50,Great lunch,"Our son who lives and works in London recommended this restaurant and are we glad he did. Everything was great. Food, service, atmosphere. The creamed spinach was lovely and the steak was cooked to perfection. Free ice cream with the meal was gorgeous too. Really excellent value. Will visit again when we're back in the capital."
30 September 2016,50,Fantastic Lunch,We visited this restaurant on a Saturday for lunch and I was blown away by the hole experience. The menu is simple but the food was excellent. The flat iron cut of steak was great. I would recommend this restaurant.
30 September 2016,50,Best Steak EVER,"Wow! Wow! Wow! The flat iron steak was so incredible juicy and tender that we couldn't believe it was a piece of meat. Perfection. Our 7 year old boy was also very impressed and asked us multiple times during our stay in London if we could eat at ""the steak restaurant"" once again."
30 September 2016,50,Well worth a visit! Or a return visit!,"We got here at 6pm last night and needed to eat before a show starting at 7.30pm. There was a small queue outside and we were worried about a long wait. As there was only two of us we didn't need to wait more than five minutes although we had been told it may be 15-20 mins so that was great. We were taken to a table and given a carafe of water and some glasses and a little tub of free popcorn while we looked at the menu. Waiter was really lovely and explained what was available and we both ordered the steaks medium rare and some white wine and two sides - chips and the aubergine dish as well as some sauces for the steak. We didn't have to wait long for our meal which tasted divine! All of it! Salad that came with the steak a decent size and had a tasty dressing. After we paid the bill we were given two tokens for us to get ice creams- salted caramel dipped in chocolate shavings on the way out. Would definitely return here! Bill came to £46 odd. Food great value, wine was £8 a glass so perhaps on high side but for London I think is pretty standard. Wine was very nice!"
30 September 2016,50,Amazing restaurant,"This was our first visit to Flat Iron and we loved it. We arrived at about 7 and were told no tables until about 9. They took our mobile number and sent a text when the table was ready, what a great idea.  The food was a choice of steak or steak which is why we choose the restaurant in the first place. The sides were plentiful and not expensive.  The staff were friendly and helpful. Great value for money.  We will be visiting here again."
29 September 2016,50,Pre birthday dinner,After a short wait outside we were told it would be an hour wait. The hostess put us at ease by asking for my phone number and encouraged us to seek a drink next door and we would receive a text when our table was ready. Within 45 minutes we received a text and we made our way to Flat Iron. We were seated on a shared table and my boyfriend expressed that he would prefer a different table. Upon this our server Luigi was right onto it and gave us the best seat in the house. The atmosphere was lively yet relaxed. Luigi explained the menu really well and recommended the Malbec which was beautiful at £22.50 The steak was tender and tasty cooked medium rare. Luigi threw the chips and ice cream in for free and for a birthday meal coming in at under £50 we couldn't have got a better experience at other well known steak restaurants in London.  Well worth the wait :)
29 September 2016,50,Excellent Meat,"At London scenario, Flat Iron have on of best offers of meat for a very good price. The sides ate very tasty as well. You can have a very good meal for less than 15 pounds."

16 September 2016,40,Decent,"I had been to Flat Iron before albeit not this branch. I think what makes this branch special is the fact that you get a free ice cream at the end of your meal, which is great...if you like salted caramel."
14 September 2016,50,Little gem in Covent Garden,"Found this steak restaurant by chance. Fantastic food, atmosphere and staff. Lots of unexpected touches including beef dripping popcorn and a token for ice cream. Highly recommend 😀"

9 December 2015,50,"The biggest, brashest and best Flat Iron by far","I enjoyed a visit to Flat Iron's (second) Denmark Street branch about a year ago. I liked the New York style concept of slices of Flat Iron steak (known as Butler's steak in the UK) for a tenner served on a platter, garnished with a little pot of spring greens, cut with a small square-shaped cleaver. Add chips or creamy spinach for £2.50 or £3.00 respectively. All dishes preceded by a complimentary pot of popcorn. Alternatively try a different cut of beef or even a Wagyu steak burger. The only drawback was the rather poky nature of the interior with no more than 30-40 seats, hence difficult to get a seat at peak times. 17-18 Henrietta Street is an altogether different proposition. The menu is largely the same, but the premises, in what for many years housed Porter's Old English Pie House, are on an altogether grander sale, with room for up to 200 diners, a butchery displaying at least three huge carcasses of beef, but also a table where caramel is crunched to sit atop complimentary ice creams offered at a meal's end. Today I was offered two alternatives to the standard flatiron steak, one of which, a rump cut, I chose. On top of its £12.50 price tag my side orders of chips, creamy spinach and a silky smooth bearnaise sauce, added another £6.50 to the bill. Wines are served by the large glass, carafe and bottle. There are a few interesting bottled craft beers, but I chose the Yorkshire beer on tap. For some reason Flat Iron doesn't do coffee, but I left satisfied with my complimentary ice cream."

On top of its £12.50 price tag my side orders of chips, creamy spinach and a silky smooth bearnaise sauce, added another £6.50 to the bill. Wines are served by the large glass, carafe and bottle. There are a few interesting bottled craft beers, but I chose the Yorkshire beer on tap. For some reason Flat Iron doesn't do coffee, but I left satisfied with my complimentary ice cream."

I liked the New York style concept of slices of Flat Iron steak (known as Butler's steak in the UK) for a tenner served on a platter, garnished with a little pot of spring greens, cut with a small square-shaped cleaver. Add chips or creamy spinach for £2.50 or £3.00 respectively. All dishes preceded by a complimentary pot of popcorn. Alternatively try a different cut of beef or even a Wagyu steak burger. The only drawback was the rather poky nature of the interior with no more than 30-40 seats, hence difficult to get a seat at peak times. 17-18 Henrietta Street is an altogether different proposition.
