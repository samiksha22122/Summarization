Worth it, order for pick-up during the pandemic!  This pizza is the best I've had in Manhattan, but if I had to rate it amongst ALL of New York City, it would fall just short (literally millimeters) of Lucali in Carroll Gardens."

"December 25, 2014",50,Awesome Food,"John's Pizzeria is on Bleeker St. and they make brick oven pizza there. Lots of weekend nights it gets busy there so you may want to get there a little early. If it is quiet and there is a good seat choice you get to pick your seat. They have lots of different pizzas and salads here. Finally, what is cool is that the seats you sit in are from the early 1900's because it is an old restaurant."

"October 27, 2014",10,What a disappointment,The pizza tasted like a frozen box pizza. The meatball on top did not look or taste like real meat. Worst service or lets say what service. The whole thing was a joke. It needs to be taken out of all tour books.

"October 24, 2014",40,"Formerly the best, but still good","I've had mixed experiences at John's over the years, but recently returned and had two truly outstanding pies. There is so much competition, perhaps the bar for NYC pizza is finally raising?"

"August 17, 2014",40,Best Pizza!,"John's Pizzeria has an amazing pizza!!!! However, the service is terrible................The serves were extremely rude! You would expect from a 30-40 dollars pizza a better and nice service. What a shame..."
"August 14, 2014",50,Excellent NY pizza,"The pizza was incredible. Like most NY spots you can't just get a slice here, but as good as it is, you'll need/want a pie anyway. Great atmosphere and great quality of ingredients. Loved it."
"August 7, 2014",50,Best pizza,Best pizza ever! The coal fired oven makes a huge difference in taste. A must when in the West Village.
"August 3, 2014",50,Excellent!,"Went last year and made a return visit this year. We live in Florida and as so many know there is no good pizza so when we go into the city we make sure we hit John's. As always, EXCELLENT!!"

"July 15, 2014",40,Old Favorite,"Having lived in the Village I have been to John's over the years. The place has history as well as good pizza. The service is always friendly, reasonable prices."
"July 12, 2014",40,Best pizza in NYC,"My favorite pizza in New York -- believe me, I've eaten many of them. Thin crust and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. The Bleeker Street location is the real deal, but the Times Square location is also great."
"July 10, 2014",50,Real New York Pizza from a coal-fired oven,Me and my wife really loved the pizza. I didn't think I was that hungry and I ate four pieces. I couldnt stop!! It really was that good for me.
"July 5, 2014",40,Great pizza BUT YIU HAVE TO REMEMBER TWO THINGS:,Johns is a hole in the wall with 9 booths and four tables. We came after touring the 9/11 museum. Two things: RC COLA and get a table. The booths are horribly uncomfortable.
"July 4, 2014",50,Best pizza NYC,"We ate at three different pizza places while staying in the city and by far johns had the best tasting sauce. The building itself is very nice. Great place, definitely will eat there again when I visit the city again."
"June 22, 2014",50,Real deal...cool joint,"Great NYC pizza in a cool place. Very casual. Very reasonable prices. Cash only. My family found it on Trip Advisor but it was reccomended from a NC friend the next day. Obviously, we found a must for NYC pizza."
"June 17, 2014",50,Must Stop,Been here 5 times and excellent NY pizza no fake cheese like some other ny pizza shops. Always good been there almost 100 years.
"June 8, 2014",50,Excellent New York Pizza,Our pizza was delicious! It met every expectation that we had of New York pizza and offered good value for money. The beer was comparatively cheap and service was laid-back. John's Pizzeria is a must-try for anyone visiting the Big Apple!
"June 2, 2014",50,"Great pizza, beer and music!",Really good pizza; just as good as any we have had in Italy. This coupled with good beer and great music made our meal. They even let us do 1/2 and 1/2 which was great as the pizzas were big. Service was quick and friendly.
"June 1, 2014",50,Best Pizza in New York,"Every time we're in the City, John's is a must. No slices, best pies. Work off your meal with a nice walk around the Village."

"May 15, 2014",50,Fantastic.,Same owners as the John's on 44th st. and the quality is the same....Fantastic. Best Pizza on earth.
"April 25, 2014",40,Great NYC style (thin crust) pizza,"We stopped in for a late lunch and the place was packed. The ambience is shabby and plain, but the pizza was very good. The service was quick and efficient, but do note this is cash ONLY."
"April 21, 2014",40,"Great pizza, worth queing for","This is NYC's second oldest pizzeria, apparently, and an institution. Very, very good pizza - perfect crust and delicious cheese. Only improvement would be if the staff would refill water every now and then. Will be recommending this place to friends."
"April 20, 2014",50,Really good pizza!,"You can find lots of good pizza in NYC, but this was a really good thin crust pizza. I would eat here again."
"April 18, 2014",50,Famous Pizza Spot,John's lives up to it's reputation as a Village favorite. Right in the heart of the Village the Pizza has been consistently good over the years. A very casual place with friendly service and reasonable prices.
"April 12, 2014",50,Pizza in the city,The line may be long but it's well worth the wait. The staff is eager to please and turn tables. Don't be rushed and take your time. Very good experience.
"March 17, 2014",50,"Impossibly large, and unbelievably good Pizza!!","I went here on the insistence of one of my colleagues, and I was blown away by the size and taste of their Pizza. Amazing fresh ingredients, and bags of character, it looks like a dive, but the food is heaven."
"March 12, 2014",50,Still killer pizza,Johns has been one of NYC's best pizza places for a long time. It's still killer brick oven pizza. Lines can be long but it's worth the wait.

"March 2, 2014",50,The best pizza,The pizza here is fabolous! I have had my share of NY pizza and this goes to the top of my list. They use a wood fire oven which makes the pizza great. If you want authentic NY pizza this is the place to go.
"February 24, 2014",50,Best. Pizza. Ever.,"We loved this place and the pizza. We live in Chicago but NYC pizza is by far much better! Service was quick, not much of a wait to be seated, and super reasonable prices. Highly recommended!"
"February 11, 2014",50,Outstanding Pizza,"If in NYC, Must have pizza here. Just great. Service Was just ok, but pizza was awesome. Highly recommend"
"January 14, 2014",40,Good,Pizza is good but nothing wow. A pie of cheese cost $16.50 and they only accept cash but they have an atm by the bathrooms. You can find a very similar pizza sold by slices in Parcys.
"January 7, 2014",30,Thincrust a little too thin,"It's reputation precedes it, but the pizza was think and scantily clad. I think it's riding on its past glory. And the seats are very uncomfortable."
"January 4, 2014",50,Excellent pizzas,Popped in at lunch while on a walking tour of manhattan. Superb thin crust pizza made in front of you. Very busy and staff very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended.

"October 29, 2013",50,"one of my faves, though Lombardi's just edges it out","Sensational pie... with crust so crisp, it snaps like a cracker. Great all-around. Nice, divey feel to the seating booths where there are lots of old carvings and character. Good staff with a very NYC vibe. Authentic and real deal."
"October 28, 2013",40,Very good pizza,The pizza at John's was really good and we enjoyed the experience. It wasn't the best pizza We had in NY though; that was from a deli called Carve. They do a great cherry soda too!
"September 29, 2013",50,Such a long wait but worth it,There was a huge line to get in and the service was quite rushed but the pizza was so delicious! I'm glad I had a genuine New York pizza because now I understand what all the fuss is about.
"September 17, 2013",50,Some fineeee pizza!,Not the most affordable but definitely one of the tastiest pizzas! You can really taste the difference. There's really nothing special to it - including for the toppings - it is just THAT good.
"September 7, 2013",40,One of the Best,"Total yummy Pizza, on the coolest street in New York City. There can be a wait but the Pizza and atmosphere is worth it."

"August 15, 2013",50,Incredible pizza,Best thin crust pizza I've ever had. Nothing more to say. Might have to make a trip back to NY just for this.
"August 7, 2013",40,Good pizza,"Hole in the wall pizza with good sauce and crispy crust. Horrible bathroom. The scratched up booths and seats are part of the ambiance I guess. It was hot, fast and delicious. They don't serve slices and only take cash."
"August 6, 2013",10,NYC Institution?,"I don't get it. Without even trying, I can think of 10 pies that are better than John's, yet people line up for this place non-stop. Life is too short to wait in lines, especially for bad pizza."
"July 18, 2013",50,Best pizza,"Great pizza. Salad dressing fab..pitcher of soft drink good value and you can't put price on atmosphere. Don't be put off by queue,it's worth the wait.."
"July 7, 2013",50,New York pizza at it's best.,"Authentic, not expensive, and positively yummy. Don't go in expecting a ""nice"" restaurant, but do go in knowing you will have a delicious pizza and ice cold beer. Wish I could go right now!!"
"June 23, 2013",30,Nice pizza for friends and family,"They dont have slice pizza, so only order the big one. Ingredients are limited to basic pizza topping but all is fresh and served hot. Just another nice place to get pizza around NYU."
"June 11, 2013",50,Best Pizza,Absolutely delicious. Huge slices covered with toppings. Loved the crust. Impeccable service. Also had the meatballs. They were huge. A definite must-try!
"June 10, 2013",40,Hot home delivered pizza,After a big day of sightseeing it was great to get a pizza home delivered that was hot & delivered by a friendly home delivery driver!!
"June 7, 2013",50,"Love the history, love the pizza",I love that sitting inside feels like you are experiencing pizza history. The pizza is great too. My kids liked the white pizza too. Loved it all. Get there before the lunch/dinner rush if you don't want to wait for a table.
"June 4, 2013",40,perfect NYC pizza,"Cheap, no frills, great pizza. Have been a few times and you often have to queue but it moves quick and is definitely worth it!"
"June 3, 2013",40,Great Pizza!,Don't expect much from the surroundings but don't let that put you off the pizza is great; choice of beer/drinks not vast but after a long day sightseeing who cares?
"June 3, 2013",50,Wood fired deliciousness,"Small, graffitied booths, formica tables and fabulous pizza. No frills needed. Not a tourist trap, just authentically good."
"May 28, 2013",50,Best pizza in town,"Reading this was the best pizza in town drew us to Johns - and they were right, lovely food, we ate every crumb, not the cheapest but the original feel of the place made it a great lunch experience."
"May 23, 2013",50,Real NYC Pizza!,"This place is awesome! If you want real NYC pizza, go to John's. This is what city pizza is all about! I could eat here everyday and never get sick of it!!"
"May 20, 2013",50,"best pizza in nyc, easily",the only way to judge pizza is to order and compare plain pies. john's on bleeker is by far the best.
"May 10, 2013",40,I love this place,Been there so many times. Not much to look at but that is sort of the point. Delicious and satisfying. A local favorite that hasn't changed.
"May 10, 2013",50,AMAZING. Go no further for REAL NYC pizza.,I researched where to go for a great NYC pizza and this was PERFECT. I can't say enough about it. The salad dressing was a basic red wine and the veggies on it were nice. Pizza so good. Bleeker street is so cute too!
"May 7, 2013",40,Simple but worth it,Extremely low-key place with very limited menu. But the seemingly-oversimplified pizza was strangely delicious. Love a place that you can get a pitcher of cream soda! Who does that these days??
"April 24, 2013",40,classic Village stop,"Still good after all these years, and often packed. Drop in for classic, properly prepared, brick-oven pizza."
"April 15, 2013",50,Loved this pie,"Had as good a pie as I have ever eaten. We ordered in, so I cannot comment on service, etc - other than to say they had it ready immediately. Fantastic pizza!"
"April 15, 2013",30,Living on its reputation,"Came here 20 years ago and found the place charming with good pizza. This time... not so much. Seemed dingy, unspecial. Would not go back."
"April 13, 2013",50,Great Pizza,Fine thin crisp crust the way it should be. Unassuming old world decor. Gets crowded in the evenings. Suggest you go for lunch or early dinner.
"April 5, 2013",40,Quick and fun,This pizza restaurant is fun and the pizzas are good. If you want anything refined like wine not your place but a pizza with the kids its the place - popular so you may have to queue.
"April 3, 2013",50,EXCELLENT PIZZA,"If you don't like pizza, you're quite limited there, but the pizza was really good. The decor is not memorable, but the pizza is excellent and the meal is not expensive."
"April 3, 2013",50,A village original,"one of the best full pie pizza places in the city,. It is always crowded so expect to wait. the plain pies is terrific but the topping take them over the top. go with at least four people"
"March 25, 2013",50,Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,This is the best pizza in the world! Really. The best. Anyone who says different doesn't know what pizza is. The crust is beautiful The sauce is so good and the sausage is unbeatable! I can't say enough about this place. Just awesome.

"January 28, 2013",40,Reliably good,"The pizza is reliably excellent. Don't go for the decor, and be ready to wait in line. But it's definitely worth the wait."
"January 23, 2013",50,My Favorite,I've loved this place since the '80's when I moved to NYC. It was here that I first realized what a pizza should taste like. It's classic NYC. It should be landmarked.
"January 15, 2013",50,Best pizza,The best pizza. Always a stop of mine when I go to New York. Service is great location is good. Take a look at all the stars who have been there
"January 9, 2013",40,yum,The salad with garlic dressing is a delicious starter. Pizza is great and you'll probably eat more than you're used to.
"January 4, 2013",20,Cold Pizza,"Looking forward to eating at this institution. Indifferent service--we asked for our salad before the pizza. Received cold pizza first, then salad. The pizzeria was closed recently by NYC Health Department. Another example of being so popular you can serve bad, cold food."
"December 27, 2012",50,John's on Bleeker,Best Pizza EVER!!! Love this place. Look forward to it every trip. Great service and this time we beat the crowds. When we walked back by an hour later there was a line out the door and around the front.
"December 27, 2012",40,Old School Pizza,Good classic NY brick oven pizza. We ordered about 5 pies for 16 ppl. The best toppings were sausage and extra garlic. The place isn't that big so I don't recommend going with a big group during dinner rush.
"December 23, 2012",50,The best pizza!!,Loved the pizza and calamari! Great atmosphere and looks beautiful at Christmas! Great service too! Perfect for a date or group of friends.
"December 4, 2012",50,Best Pizza in New York!,Loved this pizza! It was our first trip there. House salad was great and pizza to die for! Will definitely go again!
"November 14, 2012",50,My favorite Pizza!,Amazing pizza. Salads are okay. Its all about the pizza. Totally worth the wait. Staff is quick but nice. Interior is sort of grungy but that's all overlooked because the pizza is so darn good.
"November 5, 2012",40,Here it is!,"There's just something about New York pizza - and if you're looking for the best, just look for the lines on Bleecker Street and you 'll know that you're at the right place."
"October 31, 2012",50,Famous and Tasty,"John's Lived up to its reputation. The food was wonderful (try Famous Pete's A Rolls), the atmosphere was lively and the price was really good for NYC. I will return on my next visit!"

"October 28, 2012",40,True NYC pizza,"Very good pizza at a very good price. Nice to see a NYC icon keep serving good food for a good price. Family of 4 can eat for under 40 dollars. Make sure to bring cash, they do not accept credit."
"October 23, 2012",50,My favorite pizza,"NYC has a lot of great pizza but I think this is my favorite coal pizza location. Thin crust, great sauce and rustic atmoshere."
"October 23, 2012",40,For sure,"One of the best in the city, probably in the USA. Thinner crust and very tasty. Stop by when you are in Greenwich Village"
"October 19, 2012",40,Great New York pizza,"Good cheese pizza, tomato sauce is slightly sweet , nice and cheesy. Quick service, had our pizza in 5 minutes from ordering it!"
"October 5, 2012",40,One of the best pizzas in North America,I've eaten pizza all over North America and John's is one of the best. All the ingredients are fresh and top quality. Their italian sausage is amazing - the fennel is as fresh as it gets. Expect a wait and they don't take reservations.
"September 30, 2012",50,Always great pizza.,Every time I visit I stop at John's. You must buy a whole pie but it's the best brick-oven pizza in town.
"September 30, 2012",50,good pizza,its good and cheap they are packed thats how good they are. plus they pizzas are big.its really hiostric
"September 28, 2012",30,It was better on Times Square...,"We read the tripadvisor-review and decided to try this restaurant. We recently had pizza on John's on Times Square, that was a much better experience! In Bleecker street We felt it was dirty, not great service, good pizza though, but We won't go back."
"September 20, 2012",40,Good pie,"John's is great, lots of character, pizza is super. Nice part of town, service is polite and friendly."
"September 19, 2012",50,Best pizza I've ever had,"My girlfriend and I shared a pie and had a few beers here. We were recommended the place by a frequent traveller to the city. Did not disappoint, amazing pizza. Place is simple and authentic. Can't wait to go back."
"September 17, 2012",50,"Arguably, the best pie in NY","Brick oven pizza the way it's supposed to be. Unpretentious, but great testing. They don't take reservations and don't sell by the slice, so go with a group and enjoy!"
"September 10, 2012",40,Very good pizza...worth a visit,"It's a bit crowded sometimes but the pizza is good. Come here in an off hour and it's worth while. Don't wait for 45 minutes however. Of course, with 20,000 restaurants in NYC, never wait for 45 minutes."
"September 4, 2012",50,Pretty blooming good pizza.,We visited Johns and loved the pizza. The sauce was fantastic. They only take cash but at $17 for a large pie you don't need too much of that. Worth the $10 cab ride form mid town.
"September 2, 2012",20,Can't understand the hype about this place,"GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Pizza is below average, not cheap and staff look like they want to put you in the pizza oven."
"August 28, 2012",40,Slice of history,"I think this pizzeria has been here for many years. It's pretty small inside but the pizza's are really good. I had a small, which was enormous, and it was thin, crispy and very good. Well worth a visit."
"August 22, 2012",50,Amazing pizza,My girlfriends and I stopped at John's Pizzeria based on Trip Advisor reviews. The pizza is simply delicious. Quite possibly some of the best pizza I've ever had! You will not be disappointed.
"August 17, 2012",20,"Terrible service, hot inside",Pizza was more like a cracker. Service was terrible and it was so hot inside that it was almost unbearable. I will not go back here.
"August 12, 2012",50,Great pizza,"Excellent pizzeria, authentic kitchen with good choices. iIn Greenwich village. Relaxed and casual dining"
"August 10, 2012",50,Want to experience a true NY pizzeria?,This is definitely the place to go. We had the best pizza my wife and I have ever experienced. Ask for Pauli - he's a NY gem!
"July 18, 2012",40,Long line-ups but worth the wait,Unique atmosphere - GREAT pizza. Staff are welcoming and funny. The seats could be more comfortable and it can get a little hot inside on a summers day - but overall I would recommend.
"July 16, 2012",50,Go to John's!,I think my title says it all! We have been to the one in Time's Square as well and love them both. John's at Bleeker is the original.Make John's a destination when in NYC.
"July 9, 2012",40,great pizza,pizza was great. service was ok. atmosphere was neat. we would good back.
"June 25, 2012",50,Do not miss this pie.,"They only sell whole pies, and thank Christ, because you will not be interested in sharing this beauty. --Coming from a deep dish mama, Chicago-style."
"June 12, 2012",50,Great New York style pizza,We ate a late lunch here Friday and we were pleased. Great pizza and calzone! Excellent food and would go back.
"June 7, 2012",40,JUST AS GOOD AS EVER,"I used to eat at John's back in the 60s when I lived and worked in the Village. I went back at the end of May ( 2012 ) and it was like a time machine. Simple, excellent pizza."
"June 5, 2012",50,wow,"one of the best.excellent sauce,,fresh cheese.cash only ...service work so fast..dont be afraid for long lines"
"May 30, 2012",20,over rated and over priced,Not at all what its made out to be. There are much better pizza joints all over NYC and most are cheaper and fresher. Wouldnt go specially to this place.
"May 29, 2012",50,Best pizza in NYC,"Best pizza in town no slices cash only, old school manhattan eatery thin pizza fire wood oven if you visit the city this place is a must"""
"May 27, 2012",40,Good pizza,"It was good pizza but it wasn't so amazing we would queue for it. The service was average, at best, and frankly the decor dingy."
"May 25, 2012",40,Nice but not the best,The 'best' pizza will always be personal taste but I found John's to be a little on the heavy side. Worth going just for the experience but my vote goes to Lombardi's
"May 13, 2012",40,Celebrity pizzeria,"Very proximate to little Italy , on the bleecker street, old looking place. Good taste and photos of celebrities make it special."
"April 25, 2012",30,Just ok,We were hopeful to fall in love with the coal fire NYC pizza....it was just ok...nothing special about the crust. Service was fast.
"April 23, 2012",50,Amazing Pizza!,"Not particularly proud of the fact that I ate half a large pizza by myself but well worth the shame. Excellent on all counts, feels like a mom and pops meets clean dive bar very relaxed atmosphere"
"April 23, 2012",40,Famed Pizza for after bar hoping,"The slices can be described as Excellent Average Pizza. There is nothing over the top and unique, it's just good pizza."
"April 22, 2012",30,Pizza was OK,Pizza crust was great but I expected more--- I would definitely try somewhere else next time
"April 22, 2012",50,A MUST for every visitor to NY,"John's has retained it's unique style, refusing to succumb to the boring modernised style of chain restaurants. We couldn't finish our pizza and to this day I wake up in the night sweating in despair because I didn't bring the left overs with me."
"April 18, 2012",50,"Great pizza, great atmosphere.","Pizza was hot, fast, and delicious. (My date prefers a little more oil on hers, but I was happy.) Salad was basic, but good. Nice wait-staff. Great downscale atmosphere ‚Äî lots of graffiti carved everywhere."
"April 14, 2012",50,Pizza,"Several people recommended this place but I was skeptical. It was delicious, worth every calorie."
"April 10, 2012",50,Worth the wait!,"John's may not look like much, but the pizza is one of the best I have ever had."
"April 5, 2012",40,GOOD NY PIZZA,If ur in village & lookn 4 a good reasonable meal stop here They have over 50 different kinds of pizza I used to work around the corner & their is always a line around dinner time... Good early !

"March 21, 2012",50,Great Pizza in the Village,Small quaint place where the locals go. No refills on soda.
"February 27, 2012",50,"Classic, Delicious, Timeless",Soaked in history and a great meal. Went on a Sunday right at the opening (noon) and had no wait. Whole pies only. We stayed with the basics and could've eaten another one: delicious! Fun atmosphere and close to other shops & dessert stores.
"February 22, 2012",50,Yum!,"Long line, but worth the wait. True NYC style pizza."
"February 21, 2012",50,Awesome Pizza,"Its one of my top ten places to get a pizza. If I am nearby, I will stop by."
