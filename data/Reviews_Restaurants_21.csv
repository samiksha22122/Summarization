"December 12, 2015",30,Expected more.....,"Based on previous reviews, we were expecting something special. The pizza was nice, though nothing spectacular and quite greasy.

"November 11, 2015",30,Not that special,Bleeker St. pizza shows up on quite a few lists for top slices in NY. I dont agree and would skip it if you are looking to go out of your way for a great slice. 2 boots is great.

"September 10, 2015",50,YUM!,We used to go to Brooklyn for pizza every time we visited NYC...until we discovered Bleeckers. They are amazing and very reasonably priced. Get your food delivered or To Go if possible as seating is limited.
"September 9, 2015",50,Great Flavor,This small shop is worth the trip. We make a point to travel from the hotel near Penn Station just for the pizza and the people watching.

"July 24, 2015",40,Lunch,Fantastic Pizza. Classic New York style with flavorful sauce. There is better pizza in NYC for sure but for counter service reheated style --the kind you grab fold and slam--this is hard to beat.
"July 20, 2015",50,GREENWICH VILLAGE FOOD TOUR STOP,Excellent! We ate here as part of a Greenwich Village food tour...awesome pie slices and great owner willing to share his story. Thank you!
"July 13, 2015",40,Good Pizza,The guys who work there were very friendly and the pizza was tasty. I wouldn't plan on eating there because there is not much seating space. Other than that you won't be disappointed.
"July 13, 2015",30,Nice but not the best I've had,We ate here on a food tour. It was hot and we were a little cramped inside. The pizza was nice but I have had much better
"July 5, 2015",20,Seriously?,Huh? We really don't get why this is so popular. It is impossible to find and the pizza was average at best. I expected so much more.
"June 27, 2015",50,Pizzzzzaa first time in NY!!,I loved this place the area is great you might experience a long line but don't leave they have a nice system to get you what you need. I went to Chicago in August and I definitely give this place a high-fiveüëå!!!
"June 24, 2015",30,Good,"Don't ""eat in""- it is cramped! Pizza was good, but not ""amazing!"" If you like thin NY pizza and red sauce- it's great. If not (like me), then , eh"

"June 15, 2015",50,GREAT!!,By far one of the best slices of pizza I've ever had! Good pizza is hard to find where I live. Nothing beats NY pizza and Bleeker Street Pizza will not disappoint.
"June 1, 2015",50,Yum!,"Amazing NYC pizza place. You order at the counter and grab a seat a table (or take it to go). Very tiny place, but totally worth popping in to try a slice!"
"May 29, 2015",40,Busy Pizza Corner,This is a great NY pizza place in West Village. Delicious NY pizza with very nice crust. This is a great place for a quick slice.
"May 28, 2015",50,What a Slice!,"I was walking down Bleecker and came to this joint. Where seating is limited, but that's not my point. They claim their pizza is the best in NYC. Were you to ask my stomach it would heartily agree."
"May 26, 2015",30,NY Style Pizza,I'm a Chicago native recently converted to NYC thin crust pizza. I've had it about 5 times from 5 different locations. They have all been great. This one is average when compared to the others.
"May 4, 2015",40,Pizza is definitely awesome. Staff are grumpy,It's all about the base and Bleeker St pizza have this one down. Crispy crunchy perfectly cooked base. Unfortunately the staff are extremely grumpy and verging on rude.
"May 2, 2015",50,Excellent pizza,"The pizza here is excellent. The sauce, cheese and crust are all top of the line ingredients. Fast service."
"April 27, 2015",40,Was Ok,I preferred the pizza at Artichoke. I found it a lot nice and more appealing. The pizza here was nice but I found it boring. The service was quick and a dollar a slice is not too bad.
"April 22, 2015",40,As advertised,Was recommended this by a bar tender and it didn't disappoint. Crust was not as expected but still tasty. Place is tiny so can't imagine trying to order during normal food hours (i was there at 3:30)
"April 18, 2015",50,Best Pizza ever!!!,The place is very small (only 3 to 4 sharing tables) but the Pizza and the mozzarella sticks are AMAZING!! A must in New York!
"April 9, 2015",50,Excelente pizza!!!,"I ended up making a point to visit this place on my next trip to NY after reading all the reviews, thank you guy!!! It did not disappoint, don't miss it if you are in the area."

"March 16, 2015",50,Soooo good.,"If you're in NYC and love pizza, this should be your first stop. A huge selection of pizza's, friendly staff, somewhere to sit if you need it. You can buy by the slice or whole pizza's. I could sit there and eat and eat!"
"February 20, 2015",50,Must try when in new york,"Classic New York pizza, buy it by the slice or whole. The slices are massive, dont fill up too much because there are many other places to eat on Bleacker Street"
"February 18, 2015",40,Worth a visit for fast food,Good fast food that was reasonably priced. It was cooked to order but I found the selection to be quite limited. It was nice enough though.
"February 6, 2015",50,Delicious authentic pizza!,Enjoyed this delicious authentic pizza with a light crunchy base and tasty sauces. It's a very small shop but that only adds to the atmosphere.

"August 23, 2014",50,This isn't the real restaurant. But it's not listed,"Little place on the corner of bleeker and broadway. Close to NYU campus, soho and Greenwich. Try the Quinoa salad with chicken, ricotta pancakes, the house omelette. Delicious. Reasonable $ for New York . Friendly service. Food is fresh, fun and creative!"
"June 5, 2014",50,i ate two slices as a snack,i only stopped in to have a taste. It was a recommend from a friend and I was passing by just before dinner. I order a vegetarian (spinach) it was sooo good i ordered another vegetarian. Its too good to just walk by.

"July 8, 2013",10,What happened?,Pizza has always been good at Bleecker St Pizza but I could have cracked the crust in half by hitting it on the side of the table. I don't know how long they're letting it sit in the case but it's way too long!
"June 20, 2013",50,NY pizza as it should be!,Pizza with crust so thin and perfect you have to try it. There isn't really much more to say. Just a hole in the wall place. It's all about the pizza not the place. Take out too.
"June 11, 2013",50,Love it,"BLEECKER STRRET! I went on a trip to NYC and saw this place. I went in and had one of the best pizzas I have ever had! I just wish that the tables were cleaner, but that is about it."

"April 17, 2012",40,Best pizza but only when piping hot,Really yum and great value but only great when piping hot. When it isn't....it gets average. Their marinara sauce is the best - I think better than Joe's Pizza.
"February 10, 2012",50,Yummy!!,The pizza was excellent! Only problem was they messed up on the topping on one of our pizzas : (
"January 3, 2012",50,Best Pizza in NYC,Love their Nona Maria pizza! Owners are super friendly too. Highly recommend this place for the best pizza in NYC.
"December 29, 2011",30,new management???,"The place had a special kind of charm when the old-timers ran it. Now they've got guys much younger running the place. Cashier--convivial. Pizza slingers--resentful, rude. It's just not the same place. I'm not going back."
"December 26, 2011",50,Best pizza we had our entire trip!,Our tour guide took us here for lunch......from then on we couldn't beat it! It is a really small place but the pizza made up for it! Wish we had gone back one last tme!

It was great pizza, great service and outstanding people watching. The location is right on the corner and you can sit in one of the 2 small tables outside and enjoy the day or evening. The pizza was excellent and possibly the best I have ever had!"
"October 26, 2006",40,Gorgeous Grandma's Pizza,"Don't come here for the atmosphere or ambience. Come for the great pizza. The one I would recommend, they call ""Grandma's Pizza"", made to the owner's grandma's old family recipe.  A large thick, juicy ,square of pizza about 6"" by 4"" will cost you $2.50. 8 of these slices make up a whole pizza which costs $18.50. The base is crispy, light, thicker than regular pizza and a gorgeous texture, the toppings of tomato, cheese, basil and other herbs; generous and flavoursome. This pizza bears no resemblence to the thin New York style pizza which can often be floppy and dry. This is a special treat indeed and should be on any tasting itinerary.  There are tables inside and outside if you don't want to take your pizza away. The cost of the pizza is the same."
