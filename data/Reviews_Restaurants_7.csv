"January 25, 2019",30,Not Worth the Hype,We came here for our anniversary dinner. The food and service were just OK. I have had more memorable anniversary dinners at home and at less expensive restaurants. Steak over cooked from what ordered and the flavor was non existent. Super disappointed in our experience.
"January 24, 2019",50,Oh my god!,I am not a meat lover. My husband is. Here we could both find happiness. My husband had a delicious steak. I had the tuna one. What a great experience. Side dishes were also good. Portions are fair enough too.

"January 23, 2019",50,Upscale restaurant with down to earth staff,"Adam our waiter was so knowledgeable & funny. The meat was melt in your mouth.

"January 19, 2019",30,Average experience at premium price.,"Made reservations 2 weeks beforehand as visiting from the UK to celebrate a 50th birthday in January. This was a friends recommendation of the best steakhouse in NYC. The food was very nice as a whole, although the shrimp was overcooked and bland, but the steaks were exceptional and the starters were great. I would especially recommend the Lump Crab Cake starter. My criticism and reason for the average review, is the lack of help in choosing the main. As an example, I chose the New York Sirloin. I asked what accompanied it and was told nothing so I added the Sweet potatoe mash, sauteed onions and sauteed mushrooms. The other 2 members of our party did similar adding 2 or 3 side's to their main. When the food turned up each one of the side dishes was large enough for at least the 3 of us to share and consequently we had far more food than we were ever going to be able to finish. How nice it would have been for our waiter to offer a little help during the ordering (I hate wasting food). I knew beforehand that it was going to be an expensive meal and was OK with that as it's nice to push the boat out for a special occasion but to walk away the wrong side of $350 later, with most of it left on the table, was disappointing."
"January 18, 2019",30,All show and no substance,"Our table wasn‚Äôt ready when we arrived and the unhelpful front of house just stared at us as if telling us that it‚Äôs not ready is enough. How about asking if we‚Äôd mind having a drink at the bar. It was then not possible to transfer the bar tab to the table. I‚Äôve never ever come across this concept in a restaurant.  The table service was relatively friendly but we had a full table of mucky wine glasses which seemed to be too much effort to change.  Steak was average, sides were good and the atmosphere was the highlight.  A complete waste of $600."
"January 17, 2019",50,Pleasurable Dining Experience,"I treated my son to Gallagher's at lunch time since he had finished his finals at college. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the meal was world class from the salad, down to the dessert. I had lamb chops that were cooked to perfection and my son had the short ribs. Would highly recommend to others and I will look forward to my next visit the next time that I am in the New York area."
"January 17, 2019",50,The best steak with the best service in NYC!,"From the moment we set foot into Gallagher‚Äôs we were spoiled rotten with attention and amazing food! Daily specials rivaled the extensive menu and there was a wonderful wine list to choose from. The ambience of the place is busy but easy going due to its popularity. It‚Äôs old school, almost gentleman‚Äôs club but more relaxed - classy without the snooty. Our waiter was a wonderful man called Adam and he was professional, courteous, interesting and a load of fun! I had the delicious baked clams and my partner the pork belly to start, with filet mignon main cooked to perfection. Advice? The sides are HUGE so share! Also the house Maker‚Äôs Mark sauce is amazing and comes with the steak so think on that before ordering another sauce. Dessert portions also huge so time to share again! The second we return to NYC this will be our first stop!"
"January 16, 2019",50,Never Disappointed,"Decided to take my daughter to dinner and since i had a great time there a few months prior with my friend, i told her to meet me there. The service is top notch. Everyone is attentive, head waiter is witty and knowledgeable, atmosphere was energetic, drinks were incredible and the Porterhouse and sides were out of this world. Desserts were to die for. Such a hoot to see the meat locker from the outside as well as when you enter. Definitely worth the bucks."
"January 16, 2019",50,Fantastic Find!,"After attending a musical on Broadway we were looking for a place for a late night drink and bite to eat. As we were walking past Gallagher's Steak House the curing meat room visible from the street caught our eye so we decided to go in and check out the place. The restaurant was pretty quite as it was after 11pm, but there were people at the bar. We pulled up a seat and ordered a drink, the bartender was pleasant and prepared us a great drink while we looked over the menu. We decided on the Lobster Cocktail ($19) and Baked Clams Casino ($17) - wow, were we impressed. With the lobster you got a full pound of perfectly cooked lobster that was split open and easy to get to the meat, the claws were also split so all you needed was the cocktail fork to get the meat out. The clams were perfectly prepared as well. I've had lobster rolls in NYC that cost the same price and you actually had to look for the lobster, there was no searching here....you got exactly what they said, one pound! This was a great find for what we wanted and we will definitely return next time we are in NYC."
"January 15, 2019",50,One of my favorite Steakhouses,"Gallagher's is easily one of my favorite Steakhouses. Possibly the best steak I've had so far. If you're looking for a true classic Steakhouse, Gallagher's is not to be missed!"
"January 14, 2019",30,Pre Show Dining,Popular Steak stop in the city for pre show meal. We were not disappointed. Service a little ragged because of the large crowed. Atmosphere is good but loud. More of an upend chain appeal but does not quite reach to the higher end of expectation.
"January 6, 2019",50,The best steaks in town,For decades my favorite place for casual or formal meetings and family enjoyment. Almost all staff is the friendliest group in town.
"January 6, 2019",40,perfect Christmas Day dinner,"We dined here on Christmas Day. I'm sure that's not the easiest day to be in the restaurant business, but Gallagher's was perfect. The food was excellent, and classic steak house. I definitely recommend it."
"January 1, 2019",50,Brilliant,"Excellent early evening steak dinner after a day of sight seeing. Our waiter Jimmy was a class act, made the experience in fairness. Food quality was tremendous but the day was made by the waiter being tremendous, especially with our kids. Highly recommended"
"December 30, 2018",50,We loved it.,"We have just left after a lovely NY dinner. The steaks were fantastic, service wonderful. All the portions are large. The food is fantastic. Yes its expensive, but we all agreed worth every penny. Make sure you book up a table."
"December 30, 2018",50,Best steak in NYC,All I can say is this place was amazing. Great service and amazing food. The NYC sirloin was the best I have ever had. Would highly recommend.
"December 29, 2018",50,"Awesome food, exceptional service","We were on holidays all the way from Australia and enjoyed a lovely Christmas day lunch at this amazing venue. We were looked after by two amazing waiters, PJ and Alfred who made our experience extraordinary in more ways than one."
"December 27, 2018",40,Always Awesome,"Food, Service, Drink....all awesome. My filet with blue cheese was perfectly prepared. My baked potato was huge and hot!!"

"December 17, 2018",40,"Great food, sad not to see original caricature wall just framed caricatures",Pleasantly surprised with the seafood; knew steaks were good before this trip. Disappointed that the caricature wall was gone.....it was the entire reason we took parents here but we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. I think the food got better since we came three or...More
"December 16, 2018",40,Delicious late dinner,"My husband and I visited this restaurant a few nights ago based on a friend's recommendation and we really enjoyed ourselves. I started with the French onion soup, which was served hot, just oozing with gruyere cheese, and was absolutely delicious. The serving was big, and I made the mistake of eating almost the entire thing. By the time my dinner of tuna steak and side of cauliflower came, I was almost full. Needless to say, I didn't finish my dinner, which was a shame. My husband had some sort of steak with a loaded baked potato. He really enjoyed his dinner! I tasted the house sauce that came with it...I was not a fan. The service was attentive and excellent, no complaints there. Honestly, I guess my only complaint is with myself for ordering an appetizer; I just felt very wasteful and not great about myself for not eating more of my actual meal."
"December 16, 2018",20,Disappointed by unscrupulousness bartender,"I have given Gallagher's five stars, over the last few years on many reviews, TripAdvisor, google and yelp. It is located near our apartment and we frequent the restaurant often.  On a rainy afternoon, at 5 pm we went to the bar at Gallagher's to get a quick bite. It was surprisingly busy and the only available seats had a reserved sign on them. I bought drinks for my wife and me and asked about the seats. The bar tender said they were reserved until 5:15. He said he would let us know if they didn't show. An out of towner came in and gave the bartender a $50 tip and in 5 min was given the seats. I'm not totally naive, but accepting the bribe right in front of us was rude! Especially after the wife asked me right in front of the bartender, ""is the food good here""!  I was disappointed by this particular bartender, Gallagher's bartenders and waiters consider themselves professionals, and most have worked there for years.  Sorry to write this about one of our favorite places."
"December 16, 2018",50,Perfect steakhouse,"Group of 8 family members celebrating our first night in New York and Gallagher's was the perfect way to do it. Ambiance, history, and food were incredible. Overall service was very good but one of our servers wasn't the friendliest. It won't cause us not to return. Highly recommend it!"
"December 13, 2018",50,"Fantastic steak, great atmosphere, central location","Wife and I visited here on our final night in New York. We had a reservation and it looked like you needed one as people were being politely turned away when we arrived. Great welcome, coats checked quickly and a drink at the bar before our waiter came to find and seat us. My New York Sirloin was fantastic and massive! Don‚Äôt get more than one side each, very generous. House steak sauce is like a mildly chilli tomato/salsa. Was perfect for the steak or the chips. Wife‚Äôs fillet was absolutely lovely, she couldn‚Äôt finish it so I had a pretty good taste, really delicious. Attentive wait staff with honest advice about food and portion size. All in all a lovely dinner to round off our trip. Location is great for Central Park and broadway theatres."
"December 13, 2018",50,Excellent meal,"My partner and myself visited Gallaghers for a 2nd visit to new york as we enjoyed it so much the first time. 2nd time was just as good, service and restaurant ambience really nice and food was excellent. Probably the best steak I have had. Definitely recommend a visit."
"December 13, 2018",40,Meat at high level....,Good choice if you love the steaks.Price is fair enough.Service and the reservations departement more than good!
"December 12, 2018",50,Steak yummerz,Honestly one of the best steaks I‚Äôve ever had. It was absolutely delicious cooked to perfection the sides were ginormous and fed all three of us. The staff were so friendly and tentative was a lovely experience and if your looking for somewhere a little special and don‚Äôt mind paying a little more this is a must. Make sure you book tho . We will be back
"December 12, 2018",50,Worth the wait,"Gallagher's was recommended to us and we were told it was a must do and we were not disappointed. On arrival at The Lotte New York Palace on the Sunday we asked the concierge to book for the Wednesday, the bookings were extremely limited and we had to settle for 9 pm on the Wednesday. We got there early and were seated at 9.35 despite all of this the table service was fantastic with the waiter explaining how it all worked and the food was amazing. If left to us we would have ordered extra sides but the waiter advised against it and said they would bring extra if needed and he was right which saved us money. This is definitely worth the money but book on line to guarantee your timr slot even then be prepared for a wait, we left at 10.45 an there were still people waiting to be seated."

"May 24, 2017",40,More than steak; serious aged beef,"You walk past a huge glassed freezer of aging steaks. The steak is aged and very good. You can also get fish, poultry and other proteins.

"May 9, 2017",50,Top Class,"My wife and I were fortunate to have this fabulous restaurant recommended to us and we booked to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. The food was excellent as was the welcome and service we received. It isn't cheap, but then one should not expect it...More"
"May 9, 2017",30,Lovely steak but very overpriced,We had a lovely meal here recently. The steak was lovely. The sides were far too big and one would of easily been enough for the two of us. Wine here is ridiculously expensive the cheapest red setting you back $80 a bottle. The total meal which was a main course and a bottle of wine for 2 people came to over $200 without a tip. A rather overpriced restaurant although the food was nice.
"May 7, 2017",50,I'm Full,Gallagher's is a must eat!!! We there you surf or turf they have something for you. Great wine list or your favorite drink stop by Gallagher's and leave happy!!!
"May 6, 2017",50,"Excellent food, fantastic service","Would absolutely recommend a visit here when you are in New York. Ate here before going to see Wicked and it was just lovely. Had the 10oz filet Mignon and would highly recommend it. Also for anyone who is a gin lover, New York isn't the best place in my opinion for a decent G&T whereas Gallaghers made an absolute fabulous one. Also the recommendation for wine for the meal from our host was absolutely perfect. Would definitely eat here again and highly recommend it if you are visiting."
"May 5, 2017",40,Old Timers Club,"When entering it had the look of an ancient bar room eatery; which it was. Being an old dude myself I was not put off by the atmosphere. We called ahead (around 5:00) and were seated just before the evening rush on a Saturday night. I'd say after 6:00 be prepared to wait unless you have reservations. I was in the mood for a steak and got the 14oz. filet. Since this was about double the size (and the price) of a filet in Ohio, my wife and I decided to split it along with a couple of sides and some wine. The steak came with a rather burnt looking exterior and my first thought was ""great, a $45.00 throw away"" but to my surprise it was done medium, as ordered, with is by no means a small accomplishment on a large piece of meat. I've seen several other negative reviews since I've eaten there and probably would have bypassed the place if I'd read them first. But I didn't and we had a great if rather expensive ($120+ including the tip) meal. I asked the waiter for my check beforehand because we were on a deadline to see a show and he brought it before we were done eating. I did get a kick out of trying to name all the people in the framed pictures (I did say an old time bar-right?) hanging all over the walls. All in all we had a pleasant experience and we certainly weren't rushed to eat and leave. Yes,the wait staff were a bit stuffy and they dressed like butlers, but it went with the atmosphere."
"May 4, 2017",40,Very good!,"Very busy restaurant. We split the cesear salad, beef fillet, broccoli, asparagus and dessert. The only thing I would not get again was the asparagus. It was very big..I like mine smaller which are more tender. The portions are large so don't order 2 sides. We never finished them."
"May 3, 2017",50,This classic just keeps getting better,"I have been eating here for years and it just keeps getting better. The renovation they did a few years back helps a lot. The steaks are always great, the side are great, and it is always a great experience. I have run into the casts of several nearby shows in the bar having drinks after the show."
"May 3, 2017",50,Old School charm!,"A fab find on our way back from the theatre. A former speakeasy, with so much charm. Wonderful staff who have obviously worked there for years, great wine, and a charming and relaxed vibe. Will visit again!"
"May 2, 2017",50,Good as it gets,"Perfect location if seeing a show. Loved looking at steaks in glass front cooler when entering. Very professional wait staff. Extensive menu. Tried several appetizers and salads. All done very well. Steak was excellent quality, cooked to perfection. Shrimp very tasty. We shared 3 sides and loved all of them."
"April 26, 2017",40,Great Steakhouse,"The food was excellent, but two of the steaks had to be sent back because they were a bit under done. Atmosphere was quite a bit louder than we expected but everything else was fantastic."

"April 19, 2017",40,Food amazing but not really child friendly,With a 7 year old in our family - child friendly is always a key criteria. I am not sure what makes this restaurant child friendly. There is no children's menu.
"April 16, 2017",40,classic US steak,"If you are in the US/NY a diner in a classical steakhouse is a 'must do' Gallaghers is one of these places. High quality aged meat, basic side dishes, too expensive wines a top service and a US ambiance."

"January 19, 2016",10,"Overrated, overpriced and waste of money","I'd taken my wife there for her birthday, on recommendation. We were escorted to our table and given menus and a wine list. After 30 minutes and two apologies we were eventually offered a drink. We decided to order our food as soon as the drinks arrived just in case the time frame would be the same. During our wait for our food to arrive, we noticed the waiter scraping food from plates, onto a hostess trolley right in front of guests eating. Not a good look. We both ordered filet mignon, my wife the smaller. None of the steaks came how we asked for them. I asked for medium, it came well done my wife asked for well done, hers came medium rare. The result we both ate at different times, as my wife's had to be sent back to be cooked properly. I don't mind paying pricy rates for great food, and great staff. I'm afraid this was badly cooked food, with staff who were a touch arrogant, thinking they were far better than they were. The other thing I can't abide are staff who find it necessary, to draw heavy ink circles around the tip area of the check. We may be international travelers, but know how to treat staff and tip them. You have much to learn, and thanks for ruining our night. $200 badly spent. Never again"
"January 19, 2016",50,Amazing steak!,We came here on a recommendation from another bar and it was the best steak we've ever had! Pricey but def worth it... Great friendly staff who couldn't have been more helpful... Def recommend this to anyone visiting :-)

First of all the atmosphere was amazing! It makes you feel like you are a part of a movie with the decoration and the framed pictures all over the walls! The bar is fantastic and the people who run it are welcome friendly and always happy to give you their advice. We didn't book prior to our visit. We just walked in and we asked if there is any table free for later that evening and it was! We had lobster, oysters and fillet steak 14oz! The meat was cooked to perfection! It is an expensive restaurant but the rewarding feeling that you get on the first bite is unbelievable!"

The steak house serves a variety of aged prime beef, pricy but excellently prepared over hickory charcoals. Service was great considering the house is always packed and you can have To reserve a table very early in the morning to assure your evening dinner, unless you might get lucky and secure a seat at the bar or catch a cancellation.

"January 17, 2016",50,Great steak at Gallaghers,"Last night I enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Gallaghers Steak House. The restaurant has been operating since 1927 & they sure do know their steaks. I ordered the 10oz fillet & it was huge! Husband ordered the New York Sirloin & it too was huge! Gallaghers cook their steaks over hickory logs (the kitchen is visible from restaurant & we could clearly see the flames from the grill/oven), the taste of the meat clearly shines through whilst there is a nice grill flavour as well. The restaurant offers a range of other meats & dishes but we went for the steak. Big wine list; enjoyed a nice California Pinot Noir & full bar on offer. Restaurant is a hive of activity & service is prompt & professional. Definitely one to consider if you want that old school steakhouse experience."

"June 22, 2014",40,My dinner at Gallagher's,I liked the quality of the meat (as very well promised on their advertising). The food was good and the service was at a good level. I will probably go again to eat here if I will have the chance to stay again in NY.
"June 17, 2014",50,YUM!,A colleague and I ate at Gallagher's for dinner. The service was quite good and the good was delicious. No complaints.
"June 17, 2014",30,Always very good,"Is many years that I go to Las Vegas, and each time I go to Gallagher. I try many dishes, but my favourite is the Porterhouse. I think it is one of the better steak in Las Vegas."

"March 10, 2014",50,Quite simply the best,"Best steakhouse in NYC - which makes it I guess on of the best anywhere. Steak was, of course, supreme but the staff were excellent. Service superb - fantastic night. Will be back."

"October 22, 2013",40,Great steak - old school style,"Disliked the chairs - uncomfortable! Loved the food and the service - professional, quick service, perfect steak and accompaniments. Not fine dining, just huge portions, perfectly cooked."
"September 2, 2013",50,Topnotch!,"The is a real steakhouse and a must visit if that is your vice. I ordered a Boneless Rib-eye and a side of broccoli. The portions are huge, but you pay top price for it too. I recommend this place for a special occasion."
"June 10, 2013",40,Great steakhouse in Times Square,We had a very good meal at Gallagher's. The steaks were delicious as were the sides (mashed potatoes and spinach). We also tried the oysters and they were excellent. The atmosphere is really neat and the staff could not be friendlier.
"June 8, 2013",50,Memories of 'Gars and Steak and a Great Red,This is a place for business. The business of eating and the business of dealing. Perfect ambience. The restaurant seems as if it stepped out of the days of gangsters and industrial monopolists. Maybe those folks at the next table are just that?
"June 3, 2013",50,BIG STEAKS,The steak was excellent - but it sounded a little like a cattle market on walking in as the bar is located at the front.
"May 27, 2013",20,Very expensive and old style,"The classic old style steak house, dusty with more waiters than clients waiting for theirs tips, price are expensive for the quality of the food (nothing to compare with places like capitol grill for example) and the service...."
"May 25, 2013",30,Just ok,"Went there last Feb for dinner as it was very close to the hotel. It was just ok , nothing more. You can definetely hve better steak somewhere else."
"May 21, 2013",40,A good American fare,"The aging, the cooking, the sides....all well and typical. Unfortunately the staff is very rude with foreigners."
"May 9, 2013",40,"Good, but not the best","Good steak and enjoyed the dinner, but the four in my group visiting NYC all liked the Palm better. Gallagher's wasn't bad by any imagination, we just liked the Palm slightly better. We did agree that the salad at Gallagher's was better."
"May 7, 2013",50,Always Great,"Takes some beating - a family favorite for many years. One of my favorite New York restaurants. We visit whenever possible. Wonderful steaks, and the cocktails take some beating too!"
"April 27, 2013",40,Reliably good meal,"Tables of two are positioned very close to other tables. Service was below average. Lame chops were very good and filet was good. Showed up last minute for dinner, so glad to find room, but not sure we would go back."
"April 8, 2013",40,Good 'old school' steak place,We go to gallagher's every time we go to nyc. It's like it was when it first opened nearly 100 years ago. Steaks are good and service is fantastic. Enjoy the atmosphere and seeing the 'real New Yorkers' eating there.
"April 8, 2013",50,Perfect Steak!!!!!,"They know how to cook a steak, it melted in my mouth. I had the RibEye and it was perfect, juicy and tasty. They offer great food and service, the atmosphere is very nice."

"April 24, 2013",30,Not what I was expecting ..,After years of hearing how amazing Gallagher's Steak house was by my parents who visited years ago It was on my must try list. Went for a early dinner and I had read that it had changed hands recently but was impressed with the display...More
"April 21, 2013",50,Good meal fine service,in a city of steakhouse Gallagher's can hold its own. We ate here for the first time and were pleased. The drinks are good and the atmosphere is old school with great pictures around the the room highlighted by checkered table clothes. We had steak tartare to start with and steak and chicken as a main courses. The sides are enormous and sufficient for four. Rice pudding was very good. A great place to go in the theartre district.
"April 17, 2013",20,dry-aged beef?,"As I had a show to watch in the evening, I picked this place instead of Peter Luger or Sparks. I had sirloin steak with mustard sauce and had it cooked medium rare as the restaurant recommended. There was a big question to the quality of the meat (I have experience eating a literally rotten steak so I think I do know how a matured beef will taste like...) but the hospitality was nice, there were many local New Yorkers who seemed to be regular customers. It place if you want to enjoy the vibe of how NY steak houses are."
"April 14, 2013",40,Very good steak,"Was in NYC for one night and staying at a hotel nearby, I was recommended this place by our concierge. Too bad I didn't see him again to thank him. This place sure looks like its been around for a long time. Gives you a good steakhouse feel as you get in.  The staff were attentive and understood my request very well. As a result, I had a my steak exactly the way I like it. The meat was excellent and must admit, I've had few better ones in NYC."
"April 10, 2013",50,Permanent US legend,"What a great pleasure to have dinner in Gallagher's Steak House. I was, thirty year ago in the restaurant. Nothing has change. This restaurant is a US legend. The meat is one of the best you can eat in the word. Sirloin, with 3 week of maturation, are memorables and perfectly cooked. Mine was really blue, that is difficult in US, the one of my wife was perfectly raw and my son got a medium cooked. I didn't remember the Gallagher's potatoes!!! They are delicious. We drink a Merlot from Washington which was good for a decent price (40 USD), after one week of beer it is like to be in paradise. Price are very resonnable if you concideer that: -one of the best meat in the world -Times square. In France it would be the same price but without the same meat!!"
"April 8, 2013",40,Good 'old school' steak place,We go to gallagher's every time we go to nyc. It's like it was when it first opened nearly 100 years ago. Steaks are good and service is fantastic. Enjoy the atmosphere and seeing the 'real New Yorkers' eating there.
"April 8, 2013",50,Perfect Steak!!!!!,"They know how to cook a steak, it melted in my mouth. I had the RibEye and it was perfect, juicy and tasty. They offer great food and service, the atmosphere is very nice."
"March 31, 2013",30,Dinner at Gallagher's,"You Know......... It wasn't bad, but I expected so much more. We all know that if you step beyond Sizzler (does Sizzler even exist anymore?) you are going to pay for a good steak. I don't mind paying for a good steak. I don't mind paying a bit more for a great steak. Gallaghers, however in my opinion, serves decent steak at great steak prices.  It was, kind of boring. Nothing that I ate danced on my pallet. I chose a filet. It was tender and prepared the way I wanted it. But it stopped there. It was just a piece of..... steak. The same can be said for the appetizer, sides and desert. It was food, but nothing special.  I do have to say that I really liked the decor, atmosphere and service. The service was top-notch.  Appetizer, entree, side and desert - $90 before tax, tip and drinks. It was OK, but I'm sure I could have done better at this price-point."
"March 30, 2013",30,Nothing special anymore,"Returned to G twice in the space of a week for business (due to location). Easy review: there are loads of steakhouses in NYC...some are better than G (any BLT) some are worse (Sparks)...G falls in the middle. Quaint old style decor and nicely flavoured meats cooked over hickory logs for that nice 'smoky' taste...dire service (very bad and slow) and horrid cost. In the end, average in most ways...not really worth going back for me but if you are with first-timers it's kind of cute...at a price."
"March 19, 2013",50,Top,"Very very good. I stayed there 2 weeks ago. Beef was amazing, waiters were always available and kind. Suggestions: try the creamy spinach and you'll never stop eating em. Typical american steak house, if you want to spend a simple but great night go there!"
"March 16, 2013",50,amazing service,"Not only the food is great, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Best to have reservations. yet, if no reservation, wait not that long depending on what day of week. Food cooked to perfection according to your request and delicious"
"February 21, 2013",40,Expensive but worth it,$45 steaks (without any side dishes included) but exceptional quality. Professional service and friendly atmosphere. Worth a visit when in the big apple.
"January 31, 2013",40,"Great food, but expect to pay!","Our party had several different cuts of steak and one lobster. All of the food was very good, but you should definitely expect to pay expensive steakhouse prices. We had a great meal and will go back again if we are in NYC."
"January 25, 2013",30,Wayyyyy too expensive!,"45$ for a steak? And not that great a steak, if you want french fries, you have to pay $10 more... And that's only for fries... I've eaten far more better steak at less than half the price..."
"January 9, 2013",40,Great steaks!,"After show dinner at Gallagher's. Nice waiters, rather quiet at this late hour, great steaks. Wines OK though a little pricy."
"January 4, 2013",50,Good steaks!,"Ate here after Jersey Boys, and the food was very good! A little pricey but worth it! I had the filet mignon excellent! Everything else is a la carte !"
"January 3, 2013",40,very good as usual,"I've been here 10 years ago and I've been happy to see that it's still of the best, the best, steak house in Manhattan."
"December 24, 2012",20,Burnt steak and too expensive!,The steak was burnt on the out side and it was 45 dollars wasted on a steak. And there was no sides included with the steak. Never going there again!
"December 20, 2012",50,"Great steaks, will miss this restaurant.","The atmosphere is a no nonsense steak house. The restaurant is all about the food. The waiters are professionals, all needs were promptly met. The food is excellent. What a shame they are closing, NY will miss you!"
"December 11, 2012",50,Great Steak Experience,"They don't only make great steaks, they also make great vodka martinis and homemade potato chips. A legitimate old style New York steak house right in the heart of the theater district."
"November 26, 2012",40,Service improved!,"Let me keep ot short. 2 things improved: a) They did not bring the check until I asked for; b) They now carry Franciscan Oakville Estate Cabernet. ->Gallagher's is rehabilitated, I will be back!"
"November 26, 2012",40,Good Steak House,"The service was good, the food was good. Not a bad experience but not memorable. I had the filet and my parents had the prime rib. The steaks were cooked perfectly. Our salads were good. I would recommend but not highly."
"November 22, 2012",50,"Definitely a ""Must Return""!","The food was excellent, the steak was perfectly aged, and cooked just the way I like it. The rest of my party enjoyed their meals as well. The service was also excellent, special thanks to a very waiter!"
"November 20, 2012",50,BIGGER THE BETTER !,"What a fantatstic experience. Felt like I was in the 1930's and had the biggest steak I've ever had in my life. The service was second to none. Pricey but well worth it. Best meal we had in NYC. Ian Stapleton,Manchester,England."
"November 16, 2012",20,Tourist Trap,There are so many better steak houses in NYC than Gallagher's. Might have been great years ago but time has not been kind to the decor or food.
"October 9, 2012",40,after paying for hotel next door,"did,nt go in here either it was as pricey as the hotel next door but it look,s good front window is the freezer room shows cut,s of meat ,weight and temperature."
"October 3, 2012",40,steak anyone?,"I personally prefer their veal chop, juicy and thick. try their jacked potatoes and desserts. it's a classic new York stark house and it hasn't changed in years. the waiters are a bit pushy on the tips though."
"September 18, 2012",40,Very Good but Expensive,The food is amazing. We enjoyed everything that we ordered. Prices are expensive but we knew it before going. I can't wait to go back again on our next visit to New York City.
"September 12, 2012",50,the best,"the finest steak in new york,great shrimp and cheesecake,friendly staff who really know their trade and put you right at ease.the champagne and wine was not too bad either"
"August 24, 2012",50,Amazing steaks,"They have amazing steaks and very good creamed spinach. Quite expensive but, if you can afford it, you must go if you wind up in New york."
"August 20, 2012",40,"Good food, kinda pricy, would go back",The steaks were pretty good. The side dishes are huge. This place is kind of pricy. But it's NYC everything is expensive. I would recommend this restaurant to people.
"August 17, 2012",40,Great Steakhouse,This is a little out of the way but they have a great steak and a classic atmosphere. If you have time then it is a unique place to go but make sure you a re hungry.
"August 16, 2012",50,Traditional steakhouse,Traditional NY steakhouse. Loved it. Dont expect a fancy type steakhouse but more of a local flavor type of steakhouse that was started in 1927.
"August 13, 2012",20,not impressed,visited steakhouse after it was recomended.food was average at best service was fine price way over top for quality.spend your money elsewhere
"August 8, 2012",50,great food great atmosphere but expensive,we went there as a couple and loved it being reccomended to us by some locals its really traditional but expensive
"August 6, 2012",40,Classic steakhouse,Very traditional place where the meat is cured when you come in. We had the impression that this place is for tourists. The steaks were excellent.
"July 31, 2012",30,Overrated,"I eat lots of steak‚Äôs, so was very excited to trie this one. I was disappointed with the quality, the way it was cook was to perfection, just that the steak add no outstanding taste."
"July 27, 2012",50,Great restaurant,If you're a fan of a good steak and a great atmosphere this is the place to come. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth it.
"July 22, 2012",40,Great steaks,"A good old style steak house, the steaks are great and the sides are huge. Well worth a visit if you are in NYC."
"July 18, 2012",30,Old style place with great steaks,If you like old traditional places this will suite you. Steak was great and wine also. I would go back.
"July 10, 2012",20,what can I say?,"Maybe it was the wrong day to visit Gallagher. Our food was not cooked, simply bad and no, I will never return."
"June 12, 2012",50,Nice place to share,"We are very glad, not only with the steak, that was awesome, but mostly with the service, you certainly get a nice experience, also the location make you feel the real NYC experiencie"
"May 31, 2012",50,excellent but expensive,"book a table in advance we tried the sirloin steak, it was certainly more than enough very nice restaurant with a special atmosphere expensive because of the sides you need to pay extra"
"May 22, 2012",40,A classic!,"Great interior with photos/paintings of theater greats. The food is plentiful. Pricey, but it's a classic. You have to go at least once."
"May 7, 2012",40,Old Time Steak House,The food was great and the wait staff exceptional. We had a waiter that had been there for 25 yrs and another for over 40. Says a lot about the establishment.
"May 7, 2012",30,A NYC landmark,Gallaghers serves a predictably good steak but the place desperately needs a makeover. Its good but there are many others I would probably choose ahead of them for this issue.
"April 23, 2012",10,A joke,"I saw several bad reviews before going to Gallagher's but decided to give it a try anyway. What a mistake! Poor service, poor food quality, expensive bill... My worst dinner experience in more than 50 visits to NYC."
"April 15, 2012",30,Mashed Potatoes,"As a vegetarian I have been to some amazing steakhouses, this one not so much....but, mashed potatoes were amazing. Husbands filet was okay he said not the best, veggies were not fresh, waiter no personality."
"April 12, 2012",50,Melt in the mouth,"The excellent meat melt in your mouth.... Seeing the grill in action and the fridge at the entrance is a great joy. It is old, the waiters are old.... But it is very good. A must visit when you are in NYC."

"March 29, 2012",40,"Great food, but expensive!","The food was excellant, but everything was priced separately and our bill for 4 people came to almost $400.00"
"March 15, 2012",20,Don't WASTE your money.p,Terrible steaks x2...sirloin wasnt even edible and filet replaced it and came back practically raw. Spinach and mushrooms were totally without flavor. EVERYTHING needed to be salted for flavor. Complained to mgr and he didn' t seem to care. Way overpriced for food quality. Yuck!
"March 11, 2012",50,Excellent steak in an otherwise modest setting.,"Right amongst the Broadway playhouses, a great pre-theatre location."
"February 17, 2012",40,lovely!!!,"We had an excellent meal here on the last night of our trip, excellent steaks, good sides and warm service. Just a little bit expensive, but we would happily pay it again!"
"February 1, 2012",20,Go to Rothmann's instead,"This was the most expensive and drying steak I've ever had in my life (and it was medium!). I was disappointed at how old (not aged) everything tasted, from bread to potato to steak. Save your money and get a t-bone to cook at home."
"January 24, 2012",40,I supplied a prior review- was good,"But it was a very nice dinner, albeit expensive -but its something of an icon in NYC"
"January 12, 2012",20,Not my cup of tea or steak,With so many steak houses in new York City I don't see how they are open. For my money I would never go back there again.
"January 8, 2012",50,Excellent,"Excellent steak, my partner was very impressed by the size and taste! It's worth the money"

"November 9, 2011",50,Proper old school New York experience,"This place was great, quality, massive steaks and an old school feel about it. It was like an episode of The Sopranos."
"November 4, 2011",50,Expensive,"Gallagher's steak house, steaks where the best i ever had, but for two steaks and a bottle of wine $180, i don't think it was great value, and it was two steaks, nothing else came with it not even a piece of lettuce."
"October 27, 2011",50,Friendly bartenders...great place to stop in for a drink.,"I was a woman sans husband for the night. I dropped in for a drink between seeing a jazz group and meeting a friend. Bartenders were friendly and fun. Leo...you're tops, man. Thanks for the glass of wine and the great conversation."

"January 11, 2011",20,only a turistic restaurant,"I went ot Gallanghers on 8th january 2011. Now is only a turistic place, with impolite waitresses and the steak was nothing of special. Also the restaurant on saturday night was empy, only few tables....."

"August 11, 2010",10,Not recommended.....,"We visited in July for the first and last time. Beyond substandard. Waste food, waste of money and a waste of time. Good steaks can be found in NYC at the Bull & Bear restaurant at the Waldorf Astoria......or the ""21"" Club."
"July 14, 2010",10,what a shame...should have read these reviews,"Great job of ruining a BEAUTIFUL dry aged piece of beef-little flavor and tough.Could have used the bread to hurl at the waiter to keep from hawking our table.

"December 4, 2009",30,"so, so","Sat us right on top of the wait staff area, so it was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation. Food was good, but a bit overpriced. The add-ons should have been included with a steak meal."
"March 10, 2009",20,"Extremely overpriced, for poor service and mediocre food","Very rude staff, who demand 20% tip, for poor service. Meal was ok, but at $120 for 2 drinks a burger and a steak with a potatoe and a bowl of spinich is very over priced to say the least............"

For example, we both like filet mignon and that was listed at $38. It only comes in one size, 14 ounces. Most steak houses give you a choice of two different sizes. The filet was very tender (should be at that price!) with almost no fat on it. However, we wished it did come in a smaller size. This restaurant is strictly a la carte.

For example, we both like filet mignon and that was listed at $38. It only comes in one size, 14 ounces. Most steak houses give you a choice of two different sizes. The filet was very tender (should be at that price!) with almost no fat on it. However, we wished it did come in a smaller size. This restaurant is strictly a la carte.

"May 30, 2005",10,Skip it!,Nothing special here....Expensive steak which wasn't very good at all. Service was generally ok but nothing about this place was very appealing. You can do much better so move along when thinking about Gallagher's.
"April 11, 2005",10,"I like food, but not theirs","The service here was fine, no complaints. But the food was really bad. Seriously, I went with a group of 10 people and not one person liked their meal. It's too expensive to deal with bad food. Try Joe Allen for upscale American instead-- we LOVED that. Also, my husband got Filet Mignon at Chez Josephine before a show and said it was one of the best he's had.  I'm a food girl and seriously, avoid this place."
"April 10, 2005",20,Why is this place still around?,"Can't understand how this old time steakhouse has managed to stay around so long. Steaks are mediocre at best (there are many better choices in the area), cocktails are weak--the only item that I would say is good is their famous cheesecake. Prices from what I've heard are astronomical for what you get--the steaks weren't even worth the price which was reasonable when I went last. The dining room itself has seen better days--definitely a has-been. I guess they're doing O.K. though cause I heard there's one in Vegas now too--well some people will eat anything I guess..."
"November 25, 2004",10,uh uh.. cockroach alert!,"Gallaghers was our choice of restaurant for our final night in NYC.. a bit of a spash out, as it is expensive. Open plan inside, you can see the kitchens, and if you haven't booked ahead you will probably get a table right next to the kitchen, as we did, rather squashed in and a lot of 'traffic' passing by, but as we hadn't booked we were happy to live with that. Until the ceiling started to drip on me. We were duly moved, to a slightly better table, where we ordered dinner from an over-enthusiastic and rather tiresome waiter, full of well rehearsed jokes, and obviously very eager for a tip. We smiled politely and wished he would go away. Dinner was lovely, between us we ordered two steaks and a salmon, and our appreciation of these culinary delights was only spoiled when an enormous cockroach ran up my daughter's leg. Enough was enough! The Manager didn't charge us for our half eaten meals, which was fair enough. I am guessing that he didn't want the publicity! Buy a pretzel instead, they are filling, cheap, and don't come with resident cockroach."
"October 11, 2004",40,Great Steak but Expensive,"We wanted to have a steak and looked in the AAA Guidebook for a restaurant near our hotel. After noting that Gallagher's has been around since 1927, we decided to give it a try. The Guidebook was right, expect to spend at least $20-$50 per person and it can easily go above $50! For example, we both like filet mignon and that was listed at $38. It only comes in one size, 14 ounces. Most steak houses give you a choice of two different sizes. The filet was very tender (should be at that price!) with almost no fat on it. However, we wished it did come in a smaller size. This restaurant is strictly a la carte. Do note that the side dishes are enough to feed 2 people. We ordered the hash browns and jumbo asparagus and found the portions to be plentiful. They bring an excellent bread basket with your dinner but resist the temptation to fill up on bread--believe me, you'll need the room for dinner. The staff is friendly and very efficient. Casual dress is OK, too. Go here if you want a big steak and are prepared to spend a lot of money."

Gallagher's professional service staff are attentive and adjust to your timing needs. The best steak we have ever eaten in any steak house.

They must be doing something right if they are around over 70 years. Our new New York restaurant."
