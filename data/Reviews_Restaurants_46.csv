1 October 2015,50,"Great meats, wide wine selection","Very lovely place. Went here for lunch with a friend.  Steak selection is very impressive and the steaks were cooked immaculately (I had fillet). The starters are very tasty; wine selection is also very impressive.  It is, obviously, priced at the higher end of the market due to what this place is about and its location.  It does not have a very large seating area, so you may need to book, but there were some places during lunch.  For a steak lover, an overall great experience."

She had sirloin with chips I had fillet with prawns both our steaks were really good. I do not have deserts but my daughter ordered stick toffee pudding and I had a little and it was gorgeous.
