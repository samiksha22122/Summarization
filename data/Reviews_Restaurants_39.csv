When we arrived the nice people behind the counter were happy to take our order in our [broken] Italian or in English. I pointed to the pizza I wanted and she asked how much I wanted. I am used to ordering pizza in discrete quantities - like 'a slice' or a whole pizza. She recognized my confusion, grabber her scissors, and cut me off a chunk and put it in the oven. There happened to be space at the tiny indoor dining area so we ate inside. That was nice so we could watch the other- mostly local - patrons. I really enjoyed the pizza here and highly recommend it."

"November 16, 2019",50,A tasty surprise - best pizza we had in Rome!,"We spent 6 nights in Rome and decided to try different pizza places. We were disappointed the first several times. I was online looking up pizza near our hotel (Monte Cenci) and saw Pizza Florida had great reviews and was only about a 5 minute walk away. And since we live in Florida, it was obviously meant to be. Actually, it is on Via Florida. The seating is very limited. Don‚Äôt go if you are looking for quiet and ambience. Be prepared for a line at certain times of the day. There are about a dozen pizzas ready for you to choose slices from for just a few dollars. I had never thought before about eating pizza covered in a pink cream sauce and shrimp - but it was delicious! We sampled several others as well but the shrimp remained our favorite. Definitely recommend."
