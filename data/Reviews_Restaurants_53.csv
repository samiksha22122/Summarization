"August 21, 2010",40,"Good Food, Convenient Location","We ate at this Parilla (Argentine-style grilled meats) twice in Madrid. It was convenient to our hotel, the food was better than average, the atmosphere very nice and the prices were reasonable. The grilled lemon chicken was excellent and worth particular mention. The wine list is reasonable (for Madrid), as well. One nice touch was that we got several ""freebies"" that added to the experience, both nights. We got the usual ""pre-appetizer"", but at the end of the meal, we got a dessert and an unidentified liqueur ""on the house"". They were unusual and nice.  As you know, in Madrid they eat dinner quite late by our standards, so when we showed up at 8PM, it was just about all foreigners and tourists. I'm quite sure the Spanish flock there later. Be aware that they charge a surcharge (10%) to eat at the sidewalk tables. We got the same effect (and better) by asking for a window table, inside, where we got both some air conditioning AND the street view, which was nice. (Preciados is a pedestrian-only street.)  While I would definitely recommend the restaurant, I thought the service was half-hearted. There was an English menu, so no real problem for a non-Spanish speaker, but the wait staff had virtually no English and I felt service was half-hearted and we were treated as a bit of a ""necessary evil"". I didn't experience this anywhere else in Spain and am very comfortable cross-culturally, even when not speaking the language so I don't think it was us. It may have just been a lack of staff supervision those two nights.  So, bottom line, it's definitely worth a visit, particularly if you're in the mood for a really good piece of grilled chicken or steak. Just be prepared for a possible annoyance and go with the flow."

The food is great, pastas & meat. The wine is great as well. ItÂ´s not a cheap restaurant, but the food is great. At the end, before you pay, you will get a free drink. ItÂ´s a nice gesture.  If youÂ´re not Spanish, donÂ´t expect the same service as Spanish people do. DonÂ´t get offended by this, itÂ´s just as it is. YouÂ´ll find this attitude a lot in Spain.
