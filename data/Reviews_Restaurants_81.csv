"December 17, 2012",40,Good spot if you're staying at the Marriott,"Good selection of food on the menu. It's attached to the Marriott so it's convienient from that perspective. Prices are middle of the road, and good value for portion sizes."
"November 9, 2012",30,Good food but too expensive,"Good meat and food in general. Wine-list is ridiculously limited, poor quality-level and a ripoff. It is not up to the standard of the food."
"November 5, 2012",50,"Great steaks, super breakfast and excellent service.",Midtown Grill at the Marriott is an excellent restaurant. Loved the eggs benedict with salmon for breakfast. Top notch food and service if you are looking for something a bit more Americanized and upscale.

"January 12, 2012",40,Convenient and Comfortable,"I ate here 3 times - once for dinner and twice for breakfast. The scallop & risotto as well as the smoked salmon & herb toast appetizers - all excellent. My baby roasted chicken was a tinge on the dry side. Nonetheless, the potatoes and the Puglia wine pairing made up for it. My companions thought their food was excellent.  This is a visually appealing restaurant, situated slightly below ground. The tall windows allow you to people watch. I feel that this restaurant (among other things) made the hotel a better choice to stay at, partly due to the fact that the quality of the food was comparable to other fine dining choices in Amsterdam. Therefore, if you're stuck at the hotel due to weather or suffering from jet lag, this makes it easy."
"September 30, 2011",50,Fantastic..,"what an excellent place.. Glad I chose it for my groups dinner of 40 guests.  Nothing was too much trouble..

"June 13, 2011",50,One of the best Steakhouse outside the Midwest,"Being from the Chicago area we usually avoid steakhouses when traveling, especially when out of the USA, preferring local specialties. We consider our local corn fed beef to be among the best in the world-so why go to Holland to have steak! Since the restaurant was in our hotel and we were still a little jet lagged-we gave it a try especially after striking out on a local highly rated restaurant the prior night. Wow-what a surprise-the steaks were among the best we have had-including those at the better chains in the US-Gibson's or Ruth Chis's. The service and ambiance matched the meal."

With a wide variety of accompaniments in vegetables and home made sauces. If you are not a steak lover the varied menu has something for everyone.

"June 13, 2018",20,Misleading menu prices,Steak was good but charged for items not asked for and were quite expensive. Charged over 20 euro for small serving salad and chips we never asked for. Be careful what you order and check your bill!
"June 10, 2018",40,Super steak at reasonable prices,"Visiting Amsterdam in a larger group sometimes makes tables difficult, but La Luna were incredibly accommodating.

"November 8, 2017",30,Average restaurant,Food is ok but portions are a bit small. The price is quite expensive taking into account these. About 30 euros per person for a very basic meal. Also the atmosphere is not that great.

"August 12, 2017",40,Small But Quality Food,"Read a few reviews and decided to try La Luna one evening. It was late and raining, but was worth running to this place. The service was friendly and the food was great. The steaks had wonderful flavor. Good wine selection, also."

"July 6, 2017",50,Amazing,We visited Amsterdam couple of days ago and in the last night we had a wonderful dinner in LA LUNA restaurant.... Food was fantastic service very nice and MARIO the manager was top..... Thank you very much for everything!
"June 27, 2017",50,Very good,I did love the food and the good service!!! Everything was perfect like i expected before i went at La Luna.
"June 27, 2017",50,"Pricey, but worth the money","I had a killer ribeye here this past week. The owner is quite a character, and provided excellent service without being too intrusive. Prices are expensive, even for Amsterdam, but the steaks were large, well cooked, and excellently seasoned. Try the Chimchurri with your steak!"
"July 1, 2017",50,Fab dinner,"Family of 5, booked table after reviewing on Tripadvisor. We loved it! Perfect meat, nice sides. Only thing I did not appreciate was the vegetables - very soggy and overcooked. Stay away from these and the rest of the meal is fabulous. The staff is...More"
"July 1, 2017",50,Excellent Steak and Service,Amsterdam is a city in which around every corner you will see a steakhouse. I went to La Luna on my second day in this city and I was really impressed. I had booked a table at 20:00 and arrived early but the owner or patron had no problem in accomodating me to my table. The menu is very well varied and there is a very good selection of starters. The Argentinian Fillet I ordered as a main course was cooked to perfection (medium/rare) and the side dishes very good. The owner wanted me to try their home made Chimichurri sauce since I had originally gone for a traditional peppercorn sauce and I really did not regret this because its awesome. I strongly suggest the place and I commend the owner who apart from being a character is really accomodating and makes you feel really at home.
"June 27, 2017",50,Very good,I did love the food and the good service!!! Everything was perfect like i expected before i went at La Luna.
"June 27, 2017",50,"Pricey, but worth the money","I had a killer ribeye here this past week. The owner is quite a character, and provided excellent service without being too intrusive. Prices are expensive, even for Amsterdam, but the steaks were large, well cooked, and excellently seasoned. Try the Chimchurri with your steak!"
"June 24, 2017",50,Excellent steak house in the middle of Amsterdam !,"So we checked Tripadvisor and the wife found La Luna which was a short walk from our hotel. We booked in advance and it was very easy to find.  We sat on one of the tables outside as the weather was gorgeous.  We were greeted by a very friendly young man - our waiter ! He recommended a starter to share which was simply delicious.  I went for a 400gm T Bone ! medium well and Wifey had a Sirloin 200pm also medium well. Both cuts of meat were absolutely delicious and were cooked to perfection. We had a couple of sauces and fries.  Reasonable prices.  If you want some good steak, try this place out, you will not regret it !"
"June 20, 2017",20,Unacceptable price,"I came here guided by tripadvisor. I was already a bit suspicious because it is in a very touristic area and usually restaurant for tourists are dangerous, because the trick is behind the corner. Either the quality of food or the price are usually not right for the quality and quantity you eat. This time the quality was acceptable, if the meat is argentinian and just flamed, it is very difficult to make it wrong. But it is unacceptable to pay 1 steak and 1 beer 50 euros! It is just unacceptable. And cannot be explained with a small plate of chips with low quality guscamole. The personnel is friendly but it is way too little to justify sucha crazy price. Avoid it!11"
"June 15, 2017",20,the restaurant is okay but very expensive and touristic,"We went to this restaurant for dinner to have some steaks. I expected this place to be much better because of the rating on tripadvisor. The restaurant is not bad, however it is expensive, touristic and dishes are not very good. It has nice terrace outside, and the staff is friendly.  However if you want to go for a steakhouse there are much better places in Amsterdam than this one."
"June 13, 2017",50,Everything was brilliant,"Lovely little restaurant with amazing food, we had to queue to get in as it is so popular, but worth the short wait! Staff were friendly and everything tasted delicious. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Amsterdam, though may be worth booking to avoid dissapointment!"
"June 13, 2017",30,Average ribeye steak,"I regularly enjoy a nice steak in different places when i travel. Saw great reviews here so I had high expectations.  Ordered a 300g medium rare ribeye steak for 21 euros. It was OK - slightly dry, nice charcoal flavour.  Server highly encouraged me to order an extra sauce for 2 euros. I decided to try the Argentinian sauce - didn't like it. I feel like the sauce should be included in the price. 2 euros for tiny amount of sauce is a bit steep.  The side of grilled mushrooms were delicious. It was almost 3 euros for four mushrooms though."
"June 13, 2017",30,"Great steak, the rest is so so","Go here for the meat. The side dishes and starters are pretty boring and not so special. The staff is very friendly in particular the some what older Argentinian guy who I guess is the owner. And yes, it is in the hart of one of the most touristy streets in town, so do not expect any locals here and you do run the change to be seated next to a noisy stag party."
"June 3, 2017",50,La Luna,"The best customer service ever,the beef was the finest quality.I highly recommend this place, it was the perfect place for dinner."
"May 22, 2017",40,Delicious meal!,Absolutely great steak! Serving Argentine beef with friendly service. I recommend this and is definitely a restaurant I would go back to.

"May 3, 2017",40,Good food,Good sized steak and good prices! Cooked a little over what I would cook myself but still delicious! Perfect for our last night in Amsterdam!

"April 30, 2017",50,Dinner,Very good dinner and fantastic atmosphere! Prices are good and the location is easy to reach! I recommend it!
"April 27, 2017",50,"Fantastic Steak & Wine, whats not to love!","I've always known Argentinian steak is the best but you have to try the Rib-Eye, it just melts in the mouth! Washed down with some very reasonably priced but mighty fine wines, there is nothing I didn't like!"
"April 24, 2017",40,Great food!!,Nice ambiance. Food was amazing! Had the argentinian fillet steak and my husband got the rib eye. Cooked perfectly. The only reasons fir the 4 stars instead of 5 was on the waiting time. It took us 40minute to get our onion soup out.
"April 17, 2017",50,Lovely steaks,"Called in for a meal before going on an evening canal cruise. Attentive service, lovely food and would definitely go there again."

"February 6, 2017",30,Ok restaurant,The service is extra extra slow. The spare ribs are good but the portions are a bit small. Maybe they were understaffed.
"February 6, 2017",50,Dinner,"A solid steakhouse, with great service!! One of, if not the best restaurants I have been to. If possible, ask for the chimmichuri(?) sauce, a very spicy delicious sauce to pair with the steaks.. Will not hesitate to visit again!"
"January 26, 2017",50,Excellent food and brilliant service,Found this restaurant whilst looking on trip advisor. It most certainly exceeded all reviews. Fillet steak was delicious and the service and staff are very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend.
"January 6, 2017",50,Top Steak House,Beautiful from start to finnish thoroughly recommend. Warm fresh bread and garlic butter it doesn't sound great but they even managed to make that taste really good. The Steak was out of this world and the Chimichurri wowww!

In addition to my Eggs Benedict, I opted to include the Mediterranean / Middle Eastern breakfast buffet. The buffet included the standard expected omelets, croissants, cheeses and meats, however surpassed expectations with the addition of roasted veggies with feta, and stuffed grape leaves and other delights. Everything I tasted was excellent; I appreciated this departure from the standard breakfast fare.  After having such a positive experience with breakfast; I tried (very last minute) to secure a table or place at the bar for ‚Äúdinner for one‚Äù. Regretfully, the hostess was unable to seat me ‚Ä¶ at any time, not even at the bar. She explained that although the restaurant was ‚Äúhoused‚Äù at the W, it was not directly connected with W, and priority seating could not be accommodated for guests of the hotel‚Ä¶ even at the bar.  This was a disappointment at the time‚Ä¶.Thankfully I was directed (by a local) to try a nearby establishment ‚ÄúTales & Sprits‚Äù‚Ä¶. a great tiny little restaurant and bar at Lijnbaanssteeg 5, 1012 TE Amsterdam, which turned out to be a great experience!"
"November 27, 2015",40,Overall a good experience,"After been confronted by an unfriendly hostess - all just improved. I sat at the bar. The barman was attentive and made both good food and drink recommendations. Food arrived very quickly, I also overheard a couple requesting for things to slow down a bit. All starters was exceptional. Throughout the meal various of the restaurant staff checked in on me. I received both a great dessert and desert wine recommendation. Looking forward to visit again."
"November 25, 2015",30,very trendy steakhouse in great location,Very nice location near the royal palace totally new and very nice decoration ask for a table near the window not close to the bar as later at night there starts some very nice loud music The stake are very nice and the idea is that you chair them wit your other quests. The idea is nice but the stakes are served on cold plates so they loose their temperature very fast.  They have very nice and friendly personal only the organization good be better  but overall nice to eat and enjoy the trendiness
"November 24, 2015",30,Average,"Guess this is a type of restaurant that a lot of people want to visit. Situated on the topfloor of the new W Hotel. Unfortunately, the expectations were not met. The service was quite arrogant (""they were selected to work there, so they must be great""). Food was decent, but the prices are too high in relation to what is served. With regards to complaints about the loudness of the music ... well that's subjective, but I wouldn't go there for a romantic dinner. Was nice to have been there, but a one time visit for me."
"November 22, 2015",10,Sound and Service,"Beautiful styling and location.  But for people who do not like to talk: the music is too loud to hear each other. And the chef cook thinks he is the king of the show, not you as a guest... Do not ask or expect an extra service you do not get it.. You just pay and leave..."
"November 20, 2015",20,100 Euros/person & awful quality,"Even though the place has a very nice design and very nice views, I certainly would not recommend it for food. Wines were overpriced, the meat was like a shoe without much taste and we felt pushed by the waiters to rush from one dish to the other. The service was not what we expected for a restaurant of this price range. Staff is very trendy, waiters and cooks with nice beards and a fashionable hairdos, but guys, we come here to eat! Worst of everything was the price... 100 euros a person and we left the restaurant with a hole in our stomach. Overall, good place to have a drink with your colleagues, and that's all."
"November 12, 2015",50,"Fantastic view, good food, steep price","Mr. Porter Steakhouse is quite new in Amsterdam and part of the W hotel. The food is great and after dinner the place transforms into a club with lovely cocktails. Prices are steep, but you can have a lot of fun watching the young, the old, the rich and the wannabe's."
"November 29, 2015",40,Great food - Great server(s) ....,"This is my second time to Mr. Porter- I've found the food and the servers to be great. The last time we had Leandro (sp?) as our server he was really great, so attentive, so friendly, nothing was too much trouble and he took his time to give detailed info of the wines always with a smile.  The lighting is good as is the music and the atmosphere.  On both occasions the 'welcome' was not very smooth on check in and leaving the restaurant and seemed unorganized. It is quite pricey as well.  All in all I've enjoyed my experiences."
