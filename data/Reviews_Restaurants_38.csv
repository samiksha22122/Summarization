"December 3, 2019",50,Warm welcome and delicious food,We were in the mood for Italian food in Paris and Pizza la Gourmandise was everything we could have wished for. The owner was so warm and friendly and the pizzas and pastas were delicious and reasonably priced. Eating and people-watching in this cozy little cafe tucked in a side street was an evening we won’t forget.
"December 1, 2019",50,"Great location, warm atmosphere, delicious food!","We were visiting Paris for one night, and we were looking for a place to enjoy a casual dinner on the night of US Thanksgiving with our 11 year old daughter. As soon as we walked in, we knew we had made a great choice! The service was extremely warm and friendly, and everyone who came in the door was welcomed equally. We were served by an older gentleman from Spain who spoke to us in both English and Spanish - definitely a unique experience considering we were at an Italian restaurant in France, and we loved it!  We ordered pizzas and wine - my husband especially enjoyed the “Texas” pizza with chorizo, and the caprese salad with avocado was the best my daughter has ever had. There was another family dining with two younger children, and I was so impressed with how kind and engaging our server was with them. It was a great way to end our evening, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious, affordable meal in a relaxing environment."

Ours was very similar to all the previous ones....the sign of a great place! The owner smiled and waved at us from across the street. At the time, we were not looking for a meal, but later that night we decided to give it a try. It was close to our hotel and we were exhausted.  Immediately, the owner was friendly and engaging (which seems to be in short supply in some Paris restaurants). The wine, salads, pizza and pasta were all delicious for our whole group.  It's a relaxing atmosphere and was the perfect place for us. We all highly recommend it!"
