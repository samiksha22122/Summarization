"October 3, 2014",40,A worthy addition to the Chicago steakhouse scene,"My wife and I dined here last month, the 2nd week they were open. Therefore we anticipated a few hiccups due to being new and large, but overall our experience was very pleasant.  The hosts greeted us warmly and we were seated on time for our reservation. We were seated at a booth in the lounge, as opposed to the main dining room, which is just fine with us since we often dine at restaurant bars.  Our server Emily was very excited to tell us everything about the menu (again, 2nd week open), and we took her recommendations when we didn't already have a set decision. We ordered cocktails (whiskey sour is a winner) and the Parker House rolls to take the edge off our hunger. SO GOOD!  For our meal we went fairly traditional, with a wedge salad, thick-cut bacon (basically pork belly) and crispy shrimp (tempura wrapped with asparagus) for starters. All quite delicious and savory. For the main course we shared the bone-in ribeye from Slagel Farms (grass-fed all the way!) and sides of hand-cut fries, roasted trumpet mushrooms, and sautéed spinach. Since we were out on a ""date night"" in our hometown, we ordered a bit more than typical and had some leftovers for home.  We ordered the chocolate soufflé for dessert...and since it takes some time, Emily was gracious enough to ask us midway through our main course if we wanted to get it started...good service!  The sommelier Richard helped us find a great red wine for the meal. We told him what styles we liked and he steered us to a Greek red (Xino Mavro) that was both new to us and a perfect match for the ribeye."

"April 7, 2020",40,Good food,"Limited take-out menu features excellent burger and tender, perfectly-done ravioli. Very good meatballs. Fries and chicken are good, jacketed roasted sweet potatoes fine (but very plain, maybe not worth the price). Delivery through 3rd party companies."

"December 7, 2019",30,Excellent starter.,"Interesting menu for carnivore, steak wasabi starter amazing. Based on this I was excited for main but steak was average at best. Not shocking but not as good as 30 dollar steak yesterday that was half the price. Still red wine was great."

"April 2, 2019",40,Very good for a large business group,"It is not just a steakhouse, although they have an excellent steak selection. You should start with the seafood tower, that you select and set up. The bread and pretzel rolls with butter might be the tastiest thing of all. It's very expensive."
"March 24, 2019",50,A truly wonderful restaurant,"From the service to the food I find Mastro’s steakhouse one of the best. My wife loves the 22ounce bone in ribeye and I think the double cut pork chop is amazing. Don’t expect “Denny’s” prices; but, the value for the cost is great."

"November 17, 2018",30,I've had better,"I know craft beer has become pricey as of late, but $20 for a 12 oz bottle. Should have been 1/2 that. $62 for a dry, over done rib eye? This place is a prime example of ""you don't always get what you pay for""."

"July 26, 2018",50,Fantastic place!,"There are no words to describe how great this restaurant is! The bartender makes incredible drinks, the entertainment in the bar was fantastic and the food is phenomenal. Definitely a must go to place."
"June 24, 2018",30,Overpriced,The carcass is rotted for an extra 29 days. The Mac and cheese is tasty. The wine and drinks are mega bucks. The butter cake is worth the visit. However a hot fudge sundae would give the same ecstasy. They do love dry ice.
"May 21, 2018",50,Love,Mastro’s is one of my fave restaurants. I love the butter cake like most people. The tuna tostada is a must! I love the salads as well.
"March 20, 2018",50,Great place for dinner!,"Superb steak, sides and dessert. Service also very good, but they ran out of our favorite Miller Brewing products at the Phoenix restaurant."

"February 3, 2018",50,Very classy and exquisite!,"This steakhouse is in the class of exceptional steakhouses that I have been to in the United States. If you want exceptional food, especially steaks, and service, try this place out. It's not cheap, but it's worth the experience."
"December 9, 2017",50,Great dinner,"What a great place to go for dinner. Had a fabulous time here, great food and appetizers. The bone in ribeye was delicious. Highly recommend going here for dinner out on business or with friends. We will return!!"
"November 11, 2017",30,"Average, but good location","good location, but we had to wait for a table for quite a long time without hearing anything back from the host. Food was okay, but my steak was undercooked and I felt a little sickly when I got home."
"October 2, 2017",40,Another great Chicago steakhouse,The steaks here are excellent. If they were not this place would not make it in Chicago for very long. What I like here is the live music. The great and lively bar. And the amazing butter cake desert.
"August 23, 2017",30,Dinner at Mastro's,"Atmosphere was very good but music was too loud. Service was excellent, was disappointed with the $58 dollar ribeye steak. My wife had the filet and she very pleased with it, the butter cake was great."
"August 9, 2017",30,Night out in Chicago,Food and service was excellent! Atmosphere left a little to be desired. Music was way to loud and the room was so dark I could not even read the menu. Cocktails were very week and should be avoided. Wine selection was excellent.
"August 9, 2017",50,You get what you pay for!,"If you pick that one restaurant to go out and splurge a little pick this one . The service , live music and food will get us back there the next time we are in town. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and went home stuffed."

"June 5, 2017",50,Birthday to remember,Great place to celebrate a special day. Many steaks to choose from; our group chose 6 and 8 ounce filets. All cooked perfectly. The sides are ordered separately and ment to be shared. Each side is ample for 2 otherwise it's a generous taste for...More
"May 30, 2017",50,Awesome Steak,Many steakhouses to choose from in Chicago but thought we would try this one....heard wonderful things about it. The food and service were incredible and the restaurant had a great vibe. We sat upstairs but downstairs had a great bar and live music! What really clinched my vote was that the restaurant called to THANK US a day after for eating there!!!  Great all around experience!
"May 28, 2017",50,Great Date Night,My husband and I went to Mastro's on our recent trip to Chicago. I chose Mastro's to celebrate his birthday. We really enjoyed the food and ambiance. We had reservations for the dining room and arrive early to grab a drink at the bar. They had a band playing and the entertainment was great! We decided to forgo the main dining room and instead had dinner in the bar area so we could listen to the music. Highly recommend this spot for a date night.
"May 24, 2017",40,A Swank Restaurant!,"We just had dinner here and I just love how I was immediately greeted by the hostess. The restaurant is nicely designed and dimly lit. The food was really well prepared and our waitress was ok.  I would recommend this restaurant for couples, parties or even your family. It's moderately priced, but the food is worth the cost."
"May 9, 2017",50,Amazing dinner celebrating our daughter,We were taking a quick trip to Chicago to see our daughter who was visiting her boyfriend over her break from med school. We were celebrating her making the Deans honour list and her upcoming birthday. Mastros was recommended to us by my husbands cousin who had her wedding there. It did not disappoint. My husband had the lobster cocktail for an appetizer and it was spectacular!! I had the Heirloom tomato and burrata and it was delicious. My daughter and her boyfriend loved the Caesar salad. For entrees my husband and I shared.....it was actually suggested to share a Waygu steak!!!! Omg it was unbelievable and there was a good portion for take home. We shared a warm butter cake and it was amazing as well. My daughter is gluten free due to an allergy and had no issues ordering at all. This may become our favorite restaurant when visiting our daughter while she does her Chicago clinicals!! Can't wait for a do over!!
"May 7, 2017",50,Wow. LOVE this place. A standard favorite for high quality food,"This place is not inexpensive, but the service is great, the food is outstanding, and the bar/lounge has great live music. I have enjoyed every visit here and usually go early dinner hour and share appetizers with friends. It's a great gathering spot for professionals - you just simply can't go wrong here..."
"May 2, 2017",50,Phenomenal!!,"I really enjoyed my experience here! The steak was mouth wateringly perfect, the drinks on dry ice were delicious, everything was wonderful! Probably the best steakhouse I have ever eaten at!"
"April 30, 2017",50,Amazing,"We ate here for dinner with family and friends. As usual, it did not disappoint. Their elderflower martini is unique and delicious. The ahi tuna tartare and beef carpaccio are amazing. The ribeye steak mouthwatering. The sides are always delicious- the mac and cheese being a family favorite."
"April 26, 2017",50,Best list of appetizers I've seen,"My first recollection of Mastro's Steakhouse was when the waiter placed my entree in front of me. It was a fish. A big fish. The whole fish. Head, tail, fins, eyes and all. Not very appetizing. Speaking of appetizers, I've always thought that the mark of a good restaurant was the quality of its appetizers. If that's so, Mastro's is a winner. The list of appetizers includes shrimp cocktail, lobster cocktail, caviar, Oysters Rockefeller, smoked salmon, crab cakes, Oysters on the Half Shell, Steak Sashimi, Dungeness Crab Cocktail, Alaskan Red King Crab Claws and sauteed sea scallops. As it turns out, the rest of the menu is outstanding, too. We started with shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque. For entrees, we had Scottish salmon and creamed spinach and a 16-ounce New York strip with a twice-backed potato. For dessert, we shared an order of profiteroles, a favorite of ours that rarely is found on menus. Located at 520 North Dearborn in downtown Chicago, Mastro's is an outpost of the Arizona-based chain that has locations in Arizona, California, Nevada, New York, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C. The whole fish notwithstanding, what other menu features grilled swordfish, Maine lobster, bone-in Kansas City strip, double cut porterhouse, veal chop, rack of lamb and pecan pie a la mode? Not to mention all those delicious appetizers."
"April 23, 2017",50,Stop waiting,"We went to Mastro's last night to celebrate my birthday, we go there frequently to celebrate special occasions. The reason being is it's a very special place. We know it's pricy and we're not on an expense account, we're talking about a special occasion! In a city awash with steak emporiums few match up with Mastro's for an overall Chicago Steakhouse experience. Unapologetically masculine with simple elegant decor. The friendly greeting at the front door, attentive efficient and unobtrusive waitstaff is outdone by the excellent cocktails appetizers and entrees. Seafood, poultry, Chops and of course excellent steak prepared as you wish. Take your time, enjoy their massive cocktails or select something from the extensive wine list, maybe order the Seafood Tower, perhaps sushi, ahi tuna seared to perfection or their superb onion soup to start your evening. Make no mistake this is a steak lovers Paradise as much or as little as you desire, grilled the way you love it. Don't forget the sides, large enough to share, maybe Lobster mashed potatoes, how could you go wrong. By all means linger and savor every morsel. No meal is complete without dessert, their pecan pie is to die for, maybe some coffee or tea, perhaps a vintage port. Whatever you want, this is your time. And this is the special place to spoil you. So stop waiting, call, make a reservation, live a little, hell, live a lot!"

"September 14, 2015",50,Love the atmosphere - a special evening destination,The food was all excellent and the portions ample. We had 2 wait persons. It was a nice high end steak and seafood experience
"September 9, 2015",30,Overrated for the price,"We were there for my buddy's bachelors party. Service was decent, nothing phenomenal. But overall the most I have to say about this place is the food is overpriced for what it's worth. The wines were great though!"
"August 17, 2015",40,Fantastic Steak!!!!,"Great service, Great food. The steaks were so juicy and delicious. If you want steak and price isn't an issue this is a really good place. Everyone is very helpful. The waitstaff is always around you and helping you."
"August 3, 2015",50,Amazing steak,"By far, one pf the best steaks I have had. The 18oz bone in was just amazing. They also had live music, which was great. Service was outstanding."
"August 3, 2015",50,Awesome,"World class steak, service and ambiance. Truly a great experience that I will remember for a long time- how could anyone eat a 48oz steak?"
"July 27, 2015",50,Best Steakhouse in the Chi,"I cannot say enough good things about Mastro's. From the excellent food to the first class service, this place is just amazing."
"July 10, 2015",40,overpriced,"good service to get you started , felt left alone after that. rib steak had too much gristle for a $60 steak should have been perfect. sides are adequate, salads small, and overpriced"
"July 8, 2015",10,"Loud, poor service","Great decor. We were seated promptly and provided water and menus, but then left for almost 20 minutes. It was a full house, with it, it was extremely loud. Our waiter was no where around so we left."
"July 1, 2015",50,Great food,Steak was perfect. Be careful starter portions especially the sautéed scallops can be quite big (lovely though) Staff very friendly
"June 29, 2015",30,not blown away,For the expensive price tag at the end I expected more leading up to the bill. Steaks were good but not great. Too many other fine dining choices in River North area. Not unhappy I went but do not anticipate a return visit.
"June 19, 2015",30,"Good, but not the best...","The food here was good, but very overpriced for what we received. Your more popular steakhouses in Chicago can probably provide better food, for the same price. (And $25 for a chicken salad is ridiculous no matter where you're eating!)"
"June 4, 2015",50,Fantastic!,"Stayed here for a conference and good hotel. It's a little way from the McCormack centre but rooms were good, staff friendly and the exec lounge nice and roomy. A good business hotel and would recommend."

"May 18, 2015",50,Great steaks!,"If you go to Chicago, for sure you will want to have a steak and Mastro's is one of the best I've had. The restaurant is pretty classy, the staff is very kind and the live music definitely adds a nice touch."
"May 13, 2015",50,Fantastic,Best steak cooked to perfection. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. I would recommend this steak house to any one. Hadto wait at bar a llittle longer than I like.
"May 11, 2015",50,"want a steak, this place is it.",They offer the best and most tender steak I have ever had. Waiter was on the ball didn't want for anything. We were there with a party of ten with no lack of attention to anyone. Fantasic place. Great bar.
"May 5, 2015",50,Accommodated special request in spades,I ordered a special bottle of wine for friends celebrating a birthday. The staff delivered as promised and added a great big piece of decorated chocolate cake at the end of dinner. My friends report that the meal was supurb.
"April 23, 2015",50,"good food, high price",Food and service excellent. Very expensive menu. Entertainment. Have tables for one person party. Bathrooms are on the second floor makes it difficult if you have bad knees.
"April 17, 2015",50,Business Dinner,Great steak. Service was fast and the food very hot. It is a high end steakhouse so expect to pay more

"February 4, 2015",40,Great steak and service,"The place is large and loud with live music. So even if you are in another part of the restaurant the noise level was for my taste too loud. The steak was excellent, so was the service."
"January 29, 2015",50,Simply top notch,"I thought GIBSONS was good. Mastros has them topped. By a long shot. Get the off menu Waygu beef, shrimp cocktail and butter cake. Listen to the awesome band. Enjoy an amazing meal. Bring your credit card."
"January 25, 2015",50,Butter Cake...that is all,The lobster was great. The steak was great. The corn was great. The potatoes were great. The wine was great. The ambiance was great. But the butter cake...The butter cake was everything.

"November 11, 2014",50,Five stars!,"If you are looking for the best steakhouse look no further as Mastros is terrific. The food, service, and atmosphere are all top shelf. It doesn't get better than this."
"November 6, 2014",50,Best Steak House in Chicago,While Chicago is known for great Steakhouses....This one rally takes the buttercake! I simply love the way Mastros prepares and serves up their delicious menu!
"October 17, 2014",40,Good food,"For a fine dining restaurant, I was impressed. The food was tasty and of adequate size. Dessert profiteroles was huge! Would defiantly return."
"October 16, 2014",50,Excellent meal,"I ate here with colleagues after a meeting in June, 2014. I had the porterhouse steak with a side of mushrooms. The steak was outstanding with the right balance of juiciness and flavor. None of the odd flavor that some dry aged steaks have. Recommended."

"May 15, 2014",50,Best steakhouse in town,We live in Chicago and this is our favorite steakhouse among many. We love to pull up a seat at the bar for a meal if it is just the two of us. We usually split a steak. Also try a signature martini.
"May 11, 2014",50,Amazing!!,Unforgetable! We were celebrating a college graduation - the service and food made for an amazing evening! Our server Tony provided excellent guidance on the menu.

"January 12, 2014",50,Best steak ever,"I had an eighteen ounce bone-in filet. It was fantastic. Their king crab truffle gnocchis were also excellent. Wine list was good too, but has room for improvement."
"December 22, 2013",50,Delicious,Some of the best steaks in the city! Absolutely love mastros for any occasion and the service is amazing. Never had a bad meal there
"December 11, 2013",50,Steaks that are incredible!,"Service is outstanding, and although I was with a large business group, I never felt like I waited too long for anything. Meal was memorable for quality of the steak."
"November 13, 2013",50,Great food and atmosphere!,We enjoyed this restaurant on an annual girls trip. The bar is very crowded and fun. Great cocktails and service. Fantastic food and large portions.

"October 29, 2013",50,Awesome!,"This place is top of the line! I really enjoyed the great service, I felt like royalty. Food was out of this world! Steaks and seafood to die for! Butter cake is amazing!"
"October 23, 2013",50,Fine dining,"In a city with so many excellent steak houses, Mastro's makes a great addition. The lamb dish is delicious - highly recommended."
"October 18, 2013",50,great atmosphere in the old style class of chicago,"Mastro's was the spot we chose for a private company party. It did not dissappoint. Excellent seafood and steak, fabulous bar, and fantastic wines. A small combo playing some cool tunes downstair. If this is a landmark in chicago I can see why."
"October 5, 2013",40,My 37th Birthday Dinner,"It's avery nice restaurant, crowded and noisy. The food was very tasty and our server was nice. The menu is quite pricy but it was worth it since it was my birthday :)"
"September 9, 2013",50,Love this place!,"Everything this restaurant serves is special - from the lobster bisque to the butter cake - just amazing. The live music was a fun treat. A little pricey, but worth it for a special occasion."
"September 3, 2013",50,New favorite steakhouse in Chicago,I have been to the Beverly Hills location on many occasions and always am impressed! My first visit to the Chicagi version and I loved it just as much. Steaks are always amazing and cooked perfectly. Service and deserts can never be beat.
"July 14, 2013",40,Great food,The food cant be beat. Steaks awesome and the halibut was terrific. Had a side of Garlic mashed to compliment. Pretty expensive but it is worth it if you want great food.
"June 12, 2013",50,better than Mastro's Vegas,I thought the Chicago Mastro's would not live up to the venues in Vegas and Scottsdale. I was WRONG....this big city Mastro's is fantastic and the butter pound cake may be even better.
"June 7, 2013",40,Good. Low lighting. Good food.,"A bit of a scene with low lighting. Nice decore. Good food. On a Wed night this restaurant was busy, which slowed the service. I like this place. Above average but not exceptional."
"June 2, 2013",50,Outstanding Steakhouse,"Service, steaks, seafood and sides ... you simply can't go wrong here. On my last visit, my wife and I shared a 33-ounce Australian wagyu steak and agreed it was among the best pieces of meat we've ever had."
"May 24, 2013",50,Great place,I went there with 15 other friends to celebrate an event. The bar area is simply amazing with great live band playing. We all loved it so much. Dinner was very good as well. It is a must visit restaurant in Chicago. Simply great.
"May 17, 2013",40,Ok,Was just ok. Server did not ck satisfaction with meal. Did not find steak particularly flavorful despite being touted as such. A similar experience to traditional steak - nothing too special. Nice bar. Priced like others
"March 14, 2013",40,Pretty good steak,"The steak is good, but not my favorite in the city. Still worth visiting. They have lobster mash potatoes and they are amazing. A little pricey, but still worth it."
"March 10, 2013",40,Great restaurant,"I know there are a bunch of Mastro's in various states, but I really like this restaurant in Chicago most specifically. They did a great job on the build-out and the food and service are very good. Overall an excellent spot and I will return."
"March 8, 2013",50,Perfect Steak!,Went for my birthday dinner with friends. I had the bone-in ribeye and it was cooked perfectly. The lobster truffle gnocchi are fantastic and I was excited to see roasted brussel sprouts on the menu.
"February 24, 2013",40,Great food and service,"The service and food were exceptional. The stone crab claws and steaks were perfect, but it was rather expensive, even for a Chicago Steakhouse."
"February 18, 2013",40,Sashimi Tuna,"A very nice restaurant, I was there for a dinner and had the best sashimi tuna ever! It was really excellent, the meal... The place is nice, maybe a bit too dark but nice and elegant."
"February 15, 2013",50,one of the best...,"One of the best steak houses in chicago.. Great location,great setting, great food ... get the bone in ribeye , cowboy cut .... and for dessert you must, must, must get the buttercream cake, with strawberrys and whipcream...The food is expensive and worth every penny.."
"February 1, 2013",50,Oh My God!,Veal chop was the best thing I've ever had. Cut it with my fork. The wifes filet was not far behind.
"December 11, 2012",40,best steak in town,"If you looking for a steak house in chicago, please go to mastro Steak house. you will love it. price is a bit high end compare other steak houses. but worth it."
"December 1, 2012",50,"Great steaks and atmosphere, top tier service",One of the best steaks I have ever had. I loved it and would go back anytime! Price is well worth it. The staff was constantly at our service for anything that we needed. Can't say enough... Really liked it!

"November 6, 2012",40,"great service, great food, book ahead.","service was very good, with personable & attentive staff, and food was of high quality. Seafood was as good as any in Chicago, and steaks as good as Mortons and almost as good as Weber Grill's. Busy place though, so I'd say book ahead."
"October 22, 2012",50,Doesn't get any better.,"Second time here and it was perfect again. The meat is tasty and cooked perfectly the way you choose. The sides are amazing, specially the lobster mashed potatoes, and the butter cake is to die for. Don't miss going here!"
"October 14, 2012",50,very good,"good service and attention, nice decor (perhaps a tad too dark). great menu and high quality. While pricey - the portion sizes aren't dainty."
"September 23, 2012",50,Fantastic!,"Absolutely fantastic steak, great bread, no complaints. Excellent service from Stephanie. Will definitely be back. Band in the lounge was loud, but REALLY GOOD. The after dinner mints were also great - Glacia mints from Italy."
"September 18, 2012",40,Expensive but excellent,"A happening spot with live music, so noisy you have to yell in you partner's ear but great food and a place to be seen in Chicago! Dinner for 5 with drinks was $650"
"September 5, 2012",50,Perfect for Entertaining a Group of People,Entertained a Group of Clients at this restaurant. There were a total of 8 people. The service table side was outstanding. The food excellent. Extensive wine list as well.
"September 5, 2012",20,If you win lottery eat here,Very costly.. All I can say it will be an expensive meal. If money is not the object try it. I do not have a business plastic card to use. So if you have to pay for meal go to Eire Cafe
"August 9, 2012",50,"Amazing meal, classic steakhouse feel","The service was excellent, and the steak was amazing. I hate to say that a chain steakhouse is now my favorite in Chicago, but this was the best steak I have had, with fantastic service and a great table!"
"July 13, 2012",50,Fantastic Steak,The meal was great! The porterhouse was cooked perfectly!

"June 28, 2012",50,Outstanding Steaks and atmosphere,"The steaks, specials, wait staff and wine list was outstanding. You cannot go wrong with any steak or meal you order. Sides are huge so plan to share. It is a little dark inside but it adds to the atmosphere. Would recommend it highly!"
"June 11, 2012",40,Awesome,"Great steak and sides. Would have gone for a 5, but atmosphere too dark to read the menu."
"June 6, 2012",50,"Excellent Steaks, service and experience","We love the bone-in ribeye!! Unreal steaks!! Great sides, awesome!!!"

"July 19, 2011",50,great place for a night out with your family,it's a bit pricey but the service and food was fantastic.
"January 2, 2011",40,Fun piano bar,"This place was hopping on a Monday late afternoon, during the holidays. We only had time for drinks since we had a dinner reservation at another nearby restaurant."
"February 27, 2011",50,Love it!!!,"My husband and I visited Mastro’s (Chicago) with some friends on a Saturday in mid-February of 2011. Upon arrival, our car was promptly taken by valet and the hostess greeted us. We were a bit early, so she asked us if we would like to...More"
"January 6, 2011",50,Pricey But WELL Worth It!,"I passed Mastro's regularly before they opened and had a friend in LA claim it was the best steak...so of course I had to get in and try it soon after they opened. Atmosphere was great - it has that dim light you find in any good traditional steakhouse. The tables were well spaced (now days a lot of restaurants have tables so close I can't tell who I'm sitting with). As for food, we started off with the oysters rock which was excellent, and one of the best wedge salads I've had. I'm a huge blue cheese fan, and went with bc dressing instead of their homemade. I did try this and would have enjoyed the wedge just as much with theirs...a creamy sort of thousand-island-like dressing, with what I guess was a red wine balsamic which gave it a really nice kick. Next was their signature bone-in filet and the king crab legs. Both were phenominal...the steak was exceptional - cooked perfectly on the inside, and had a nice crispy outside. Sides went with the lyonnaise potatoes, which were delicious, and the creamed spinach, which was equally as good. I wanted to try the gorgonzola mac, but wanted to be able to stand up after dinner - next time. We were going to throw in the towel but the server sold me on the butter cake, and man I'm glad she did. Clearly not healthy, but it was straight crack. The only change I guess I can suggest is the blue cheese stuffed olives were definitely bought pre-stuffed...makes for a better tini when they are stuffed on location with fresh blue.  Overall it was first-rate experience - I look forward to returning soon."
"January 2, 2011",40,Fun piano bar,"This place was hopping on a Monday late afternoon, during the holidays. We only had time for drinks since we had a dinner reservation at another nearby restaurant."
"December 12, 2010",50,Simply the Best Steak & Seafood Combo in Chicago,"So the rumor is that many restaurants haven't made it at this location. Mastro's will make it an make it big. In my book, Morton's nudges out Ruth's Chris and I would put the food, the service and the presentation at Mastro's (so the total experience) above Morton's, though Mastro's steakk finishes somewhere in between the two.  We visited on a Monday night and there were numerous people dining in both the upstairs and downstairs dining rooms as well as at the bar area, which is quite large.  The wine selection here is above average, but be prepared to spend big $$ on drinks and dinner. We shared a variety of red wines and the selection was generous without being overwhelming.  For our first course we ordered the custom seafood which was presented in a large community-style silver bowl. The crab legs, tuna and gigantic shrimp were served on ice with what appeared to be dry ice ""smoking"" from the center. Often, larger shrimp can be tasteless but this wasn't so at Mastro's.  Some in our party ordered seafood entrees and some ordered steak. All agreed it was fantastic. I had the bone-in ribeye and it was simply fantastic (it should be at $43). Presentation was perfect. The steak was cooked perfectly, slightly crusted on the outside, medium rare and melted in my mouth.  Our sides were asparagus, which was almost as good as the asparagus my wife cooks, and lobster mashed potatoes, which is definitely recommended. I'm not a dessert guy, but one in our party had a birthday and I was assured that everyone was in love with the bread pudding-type finale! Wish I would've tried the key lime pie but was sated and satisfied.  Spend the money. Go there on a special occasion. Impress a client. Make it Mastro's."
"February 27, 2011",50,Love it!!!,"My husband and I visited Mastro’s (Chicago) with some friends on a Saturday in mid-February of 2011. Upon arrival, our car was promptly taken by valet and the hostess greeted us. We were a bit early, so she asked us if we would like to take our table right away or have a cocktail in the bar. We decided to have a drink in the bar first, which turned out to be a pleasant experience and a nice warm-up for dinner. The bar is dimly-lit, with a very cool backlit display of liquor bottles behind the bar, walls of wine and champagne, and the bartenders are very well-trained, efficient, and informative. It was busy, but not so busy that we could not find seats at the bar – sort of the perfect amount of people. After a cocktail, we were taken up the red, winding staircase to our table. The room décor is kind of “Mad Men”, with ice blue silk curtains and contemporary modern chandeliers. It is elegant and chic, but still very comfortable. Our servers were upbeat, efficient, knowledgeable, and very on top of their game. Our table ordered 1 bone-in filet, 3 bone-in ribeyes (2 with extra seasoning), an order of black truffle gnocchi, gorgonzola mac’n’cheese, wasabi mashed potatoes, and a warm butter cake for dessert. All of the food was fabulous – honestly, everything was sooooo good. The steaks were perfectly cooked and, of course, were the highlight of the meal. The glasses of wine were very generous. However, the black truffle gnocchi was a major highlight – YUM! Dinner here is not cheap (plan for $100 per person, give or take), but this was the best overall dining experience that we have had in memory and we hope to return as often as possible. Thus, highly recommended!!!"

The crab legs, tuna and gigantic shrimp were served on ice with what appeared to be dry ice ""smoking"" from the center. Often, larger shrimp can be tasteless but this wasn't so at Mastro's.  Some in our party ordered seafood entrees and some ordered steak. All agreed it was fantastic. I had the bone-in ribeye and it was simply fantastic (it should be at $43). Presentation was perfect. The steak was cooked perfectly, slightly crusted on the outside, medium rare and melted in my mouth.  Our sides were asparagus, which was almost as good as the asparagus my wife cooks, and lobster mashed potatoes, which is definitely recommended. I'm not a dessert guy, but one in our party had a birthday and I was assured that everyone was in love with the bread pudding-type finale! Wish I would've tried the key lime pie but was sated and satisfied.  Spend the money. Go there on a special occasion. Impress a client. Make it Mastro's."
"February 27, 2011",50,Love it!!!,"My husband and I visited Mastro’s (Chicago) with some friends on a Saturday in mid-February of 2011. Upon arrival, our car was promptly taken by valet and the hostess greeted us. We were a bit early, so she asked us if we would like to...More"
"January 6, 2011",50,Pricey But WELL Worth It!,"I passed Mastro's regularly before they opened and had a friend in LA claim it was the best steak...so of course I had to get in and try it soon after they opened. Atmosphere was great - it has that dim light you find in any good traditional steakhouse. The tables were well spaced (now days a lot of restaurants have tables so close I can't tell who I'm sitting with). As for food, we started off with the oysters rock which was excellent, and one of the best wedge salads I've had. I'm a huge blue cheese fan, and went with bc dressing instead of their homemade. I did try this and would have enjoyed the wedge just as much with theirs...a creamy sort of thousand-island-like dressing, with what I guess was a red wine balsamic which gave it a really nice kick. Next was their signature bone-in filet and the king crab legs. Both were phenominal...the steak was exceptional - cooked perfectly on the inside, and had a nice crispy outside. Sides went with the lyonnaise potatoes, which were delicious, and the creamed spinach, which was equally as good. I wanted to try the gorgonzola mac, but wanted to be able to stand up after dinner - next time. We were going to throw in the towel but the server sold me on the butter cake, and man I'm glad she did. Clearly not healthy, but it was straight crack. The only change I guess I can suggest is the blue cheese stuffed olives were definitely bought pre-stuffed...makes for a better tini when they are stuffed on location with fresh blue.  Overall it was first-rate experience - I look forward to returning soon."
"January 2, 2011",40,Fun piano bar,"This place was hopping on a Monday late afternoon, during the holidays. We only had time for drinks since we had a dinner reservation at another nearby restaurant."
"December 12, 2010",50,Simply the Best Steak & Seafood Combo in Chicago,"So the rumor is that many restaurants haven't made it at this location. Mastro's will make it an make it big. In my book, Morton's nudges out Ruth's Chris and I would put the food, the service and the presentation at Mastro's (so the total experience) above Morton's, though Mastro's steakk finishes somewhere in between the two.  We visited on a Monday night and there were numerous people dining in both the upstairs and downstairs dining rooms as well as at the bar area, which is quite large.  The wine selection here is above average, but be prepared to spend big $$ on drinks and dinner. We shared a variety of red wines and the selection was generous without being overwhelming.

"May 10, 2020",50,Great Mother’s Day Covid-19 meal,We picked up a Mother’s Day meal during the Covid-19 pandemic- and it was great! Warming directions were included. It made for a very memorable Mother’s Day during difficult circumstances.
"March 21, 2020",40,One of the Better Chains,Attentive service with a varied American food menu. Lots of choices. An excellent wine selection. Attractive interior. This restaurant seems to continue to improve during the past few years. I just wish the steaks were a little higher quality. Not inexpensive.
"March 9, 2020",50,Anniversary Dinner,"We had an unbelievable evening. Our waiter, Scott was so attentive. We had a special decorated table for our anniversary. A thank you note, champagne toast and anniversary dessert. The entire evening was perfect."

"November 29, 2019",50,"Thanksgiving dinner— great meal, but know before you go",We had a fantastic thanksgiving meal — traditional turkey and fixings — all was great and we left stuffed. It came on a plate to the table — no buffet! You could also order from the regular menu. They had great wine as well. I think this was just because of thanksgiving because people lingered from what they said... but we weren’t seated until half an hour past our reservation time — so with arriving early we waited over forty minutes. The bar was packed but about half that time we were able to sit down. The staff was all wonderful and took care of us well... so while normally that would be a poor rating I can’t downgrade their rating. If you go on Thanksgiving you might want to reserve on the early side or go earlier in the day before they back up... or just know it may be a slower experience... but I would definitely go there again for Thanksgiving if we where are in town again for Thanksgiving!
"November 22, 2019",40,Dinner,"All in all it was a nice experience. The service was great and there was no pressure. We were in town for my wife's birthday and thought wed check it out. We both got seafood with lobster/crab cakes for an appetizer. The crab cakes were great however, the entrees fell short of our expectations. We will visit again, next time we will order something other than seafood."
"November 16, 2019",40,Great example of the upscale steak chain,"We visited here for dinner whilst in Chicago, having had good experience at the same chain in Washington DC.  The food is well sourced and fresh, including great steaks, fish and seafood choices. We chose a tuna tartare sharer, wagyu 22oz tomahawk steak to share.  The tuna was silky and tender, the steak cooked to perfection and the sides of creamy mash and green beans also good.  We ended the meal with signature desserts of coconut cream pie and cheesecake, these did not disappoint.  Wine list is extensive and we chose a good Californian cabernet sauvignon.  Our server Ralph was helpful and friendly. We recommend and will return."

"September 23, 2012",30,Overpriced,"If you don't mind paying too much for a cocktail and your meal, then definitely go here. Although the food is good, it isn't worth the cost. There are so many other restaurants to choose from."

"September 24, 2005",50,great food wonderful service,We had dinner here for my husband's birthday and could not have been more pleased with this restaurant. We were promptly seated for our 5 oclock reservation. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. When our bread basket arrived it was piping hot with the best bread I have ever tasted and whipped butter instead of those ice cold hard squares of butter. I had a wonderful spinach salad and my husband ordered lump crab with avocado appetizer. The crab was very sweet and fresh. For entrees my husband chose the porcini rub delmonico with balsamic vinagrette and I chose the slice filet with mushroom and onions. Both were house specials and perfectly cooked as requested. The 22 oz for my husband and 10 oz for my self allowed us to have some room for dessert. We were going to share a coconut cream pie(shortbread pie crust with mounds of whipped cream and fluffy coconut filling) but suprisingly they also brought out a heavenly flourless chocolate espresso cake unlike anything I have ever tasted. (no flour no mousse no icing). The waiter did not charge us for either one of the desserts which was very generous. We really enjoyed this dinner and would return again for a special occasion. The decor is definitely gentleman's club and would not recommend bringing young children.bn

"December 3, 2013",50,First Class Service and Experience!,"This place is one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to. Excellent atmosphere and amazing service. The steaks are top-notch quality.

"November 21, 2013",50,No one compares,"I visited Gibsons twice in the past few months, once for dinner and once for lunch. The service, atmosphere, and food are all excellent. It is what the others in the area strive to achieve but fall short. I dined with my family for dinner (we have teenagers), and had lunch by myself in the bar and both times the service exceeded my expectations. We are heading there this Saturday once again, because it is the only thing I wanted for my birthday. If you go, order the crabmeat avocado appetizer!"
"November 20, 2013",50,Food and Service Nirvana?!!,"Have you ever been some place that some states “ ..The best you have ever had?” and you think to yourself; ..“self, ...what the heck do they know about the best I ever had?” . Travellingabout with a food bucket list included the following items from Chicago: Chicago style steak, deep-dish pizza and a Chicago style hot dog. Gibsons bar and Steakhouse was described as one of those “the best you ever had” places. Failing to secure a reservation on a Friday evening, a telephone call with a plea brought an opportunity for an early table (5:30 pm). Upon a timely arrival, the piano bar was large, filled with happy patrons and looked inviting. We were escorted to our table and the experience began here. Our incredible server with only 22 years of service at this location (!!!!!) was in perfect alignment with the beautiful and upscale dining room in traditional colors of wood and lighting scenes. The display of steaks and seafood tableside with a complete narrative by our waiter made the dining selection amazing and memorable. A recommendation for the signature lobster bisque ($6.50) brought a deep bowl of a complex and light creamed soup with a hint sherry, truffle oil and lobster. Sadly, this is only available by the bowl and not the gallon. I was convinced I have not had any better Lobster Bisque ANYWHERE. I ordered the W. R.’s Chicago Cut (22 oz. bone in T-bone, $51.75) that was perfect for two people to share. The W. R. steak was requested “Chicago Style”, charred outside, pink medium rare inside. As an addition, Asparagus with hollandaise sauce ($10.75) requested grilled, brought a large serving of perfectly grilled, jumbo stalks of delicious green and a well-balanced sauce. The serving staff continued to be ever vigilant without imposing. Upon arrival of the W.R. steak, our server stood by after asking if I would like to cut in to the steak to ensure satisfaction. This was an old-style, professional waiter/customer appreciation moment. The steak was PERFECT and smiles traveled around the table and left with the server being as happy as we were. This was a huge meal and worth every bit. Despite the offers of incredible desserts, this foodie was stuffed full of happiness as this remarkable dinner. After rejecting the desserts respectfully, the serving staff showed up with a slice of carrot cake and a candle for a quick birthday wish for me. How they knew it was my birthday I do not know, but a fine capper for what I am calling, my food nirvana experience. I will challenge this with a visit to the Chicago Chop House next month (look for the review) and recap the winner in a second visit in December. I give my highest praise and gratitude to the staff, chef and management of this Chicago icon. Almost every food and beverage server and staff should visit to see the finest professionals display their craft and lead the city on hospitality, food service and table service."
"November 20, 2013",50,Great Steaks,"I've gotta tell ya, I've eaten at many of the best steakhouses around the country, and I can't think of a steak I like better than the filet I just ate at Gibson's. Outstanding. By the way, if you think you have room for dessert, you better be extremely hungry; their slices of cake are enormous."
"November 15, 2013",50,Great Steak!,We went to Gibson's and found everything to be excellent. The service was great and the steak was not disappointing either. We will return in the future! Reservations are recommended!
"November 14, 2013",50,what a scene!,"I cannot recall a restaurant with a more vibrant scene. The bar area in huge yet it was jam packed - at 930pm on a Saturday. The energy was fantastic. That carried forward to our table where we had a great meal. The steaks were great. So was the lobster bisque and the oysters. Best of all was being taken care of by Elvis, our waiter. If you are lucky enough to sit in his section you will enjoy the evening that much more."
"November 11, 2013",50,The King of Steakhouses,"We always visit Gibsons when in Chicago and it never ever disappoints, the last few days we have been there twice for lunch and it is faultless, the service is outstanding and the food amazing, always cooked exactly as ordered, the ONLY ""complaint"" is that there is far too much but it's so hard not to overeat as it is so delicious. If you have any room left for dessert try the key lime pie but only order 1 to share amongst four and then try to finish it (there were three of us and we could only manage half but they boxed the rest up for us to have with coffee later when we got back to our hotel. Have tried countless other steakhouses in the USA over many years but this is definitely the best and the only way to confirm that for the doubters is to go there."
"November 8, 2013",30,Elegant lunch atmosphere,"We wanted to have an authentic Chicago-lunch and were given a hint of Gibsons. The atmosphere was rather elegant: most of the guests having tailor made suits and having a relaxed business lunch. The service was excellent even if we were just wearing jeans and t-shirts. The food was ok, but not so magnificent as you could have expected. Tuna salad was cold (as expected), but somehow too cold and not so tasty after all. I could visit again, but would definitely try something different."
"November 5, 2013",40,great restaurant,"we were a group of 30 people and each single person took another starter and main dish, but no problem at all for tis restaurant. All food came nicely together, all warm and very fresh! very good food quality, not only steak but also fish and other dishes. Affordible and good wine list. Maybe one small minus, it's located in the basement and so has no direct light, but the friendliness of the waiters and the great food compensate this. Absolutely a restaurant you need to visit!"
"November 3, 2013",50,Some of the best steak in Chicago,"Great atmosphere, excellent food, service and all around fun place for a good meal. The steaks are always cooked to perfection, the sides are enough to split between 3, the desserts are as huge as your head. Would recommend for a date night, special occasion, or for out of town guests."
"October 20, 2013",50,Jill B,We had lunch late in the afternoon just as the menu was changing. The waitress was very accomadating and offered us a choice of either the lunch or dinner menu. The food was very fresh and very good. One of our best meals in Chicago!

They had heard lots of good things about Benny's so we decided to try it out. Boy are we happy we did! The service was fun and attentive, the food was over the top delicious (but pricey) and the atmosphere was perfect. My husband and I had the bone-in filet (cooked precisely as ordered) and our friends enjoyed the rib eye and the sturgeon (yes, at a chophouse!). We all raved about the perfection of each of our dishes. The mac and cheese, as well as the mashed potatoes were excellent. The selection of the wines were fabulous. Since we were visiting from California, we were surprised to see many of our favorite Napa wines on the list. We finished the evening with coffee and dessert and left extremely satisfied. Be warned, the price is comparable to other high-end steak houses but you will definitely get your money's worth."

"May 23, 2019",50,Can't go wrong!,This was my first time visiting Smith & Wollensky. This restaurant is a Chicago icon and wanted to see for myself if it was due to its past success or if it was based on its day to day merits. The answer was simple: they take care of every single detail from an excellent service to their extraordinary food. Their wine list is impressive. We had a red from Napa called Quilt which proved to pair well with our steaks.
"May 22, 2019",30,Sooooo expensive....,"Let’s start with the positives:  Location - terrific Service - very good (friendly, helpful, and the right level of attentiveness) Linen tablecloths and napkins - tick Food - good.  On the less positive side: Medium rare does not mean medium (I note other reviewers have had similar issues).  I could cope with that if I were not paying $50 (£40) for a steak (with a little salad garnish). The prices here are astronomical. Paying $9 for some very average fries is almost insulting. Everything else is on a similarly overpriced scale. I wished I’d checked the menu before sitting down. I don’t mind paying good money for top quality but this was taking the proverbial..."
"May 13, 2019",50,"Amazing meal, best I've ever had hands down",Jennifer waited on us like royalty in the lower level grill. We sat at a table next to the glass for a great view of the river traffic. The bone in Ribeye my wife had could be cut with a fork. The twin stuffed lobster tails we excellently prepared with a generous amount of crab meat stuffing. The wine list covered all the spectrum's of a diners needs. We had a 2015 Darioush Cabernet that was reasonably priced at $210.00. It was decanted and served in a great crystal decanter. This was not a stuffy place but the food was as if you were having dinner in the finest restaurant. Could not be happier with our experience.
"May 10, 2019",50,"Wonderful location, great service, good food","I took my father here for his 60th birthday. The server wished him a happy birthday and he was even given a birthday card from management. Was a very nice touch and thoughtful. I had the bone-in ribeye and my dad has the New York strip. We were both very pleased. Sides were a salad, asparagus and mac and cheese. All were above average. The restaurant also included a big piece of cake on the house! Additionally the location is perfect. Right on the Chicago River with city views. Highly recommend this place."
"May 10, 2019",40,Nice place for a relaxing dinner river front,"Nice place on the river, with an outdoor area, but the interior is also pleasant. As a starter always serve excellent brioche with butter, we have continued with the dry aged rib-eye, very good and cooked to perfection. The dessert is American format, so huge portions and very sweet. Bill isn't cheap at all but no different from other restaurants of this this chain. Pleasant and accurate service."
"May 7, 2019",30,"Average, expensive steak","We went here after looking up good steak places in Chicago that weren't too far because it was wet and cold and this was just next to the Langham where we stayed  I'll break the review down into components  Service - 5/5; our waiter was friendly, knowledgable and helpful...the brioche starter that was free was delicious  Sides - 2/5....ok so the truffle mac n cheese was nice but not mind blowing, the whipped potato had enough pepper in it to initiate a coughing fit and was not enjoyable to eat at all and the sauteed spinach was inedible - the amount of garlic was so out of proportion we genuinely didn't and couldn't eat it  Steak - 4/5, it was a great steak and it was good well...I have had far better steak for far cheaper at Sydney fine dining restaurants and steakhouses  Will I go back - no"
"May 4, 2019",30,"Food great, service average","Food was fantastic, but the service was below average. Was seated and my napkin was missing and had to ask twice for one. Our server was distracted by a larger table but another server was observant and came to take our order. When our dinner was served our plates were dumped on our table, and desert our plates felt like they were thrown on the table. Food was great but would not go back for the price and below average service."
"April 28, 2019",50,Great place for dinner before a show,"We had the great pleasure of dining here before a show at The Chicago Theatre. The staff was very accommodating, friendly and unobtrusive. Our waiter made fantastic suggestions and made sure everything we ordered was perfect. The aged rib eye was perfectly cooked and incredible flavorful. My husband had a NY strip with Gorgonzola baked on which was an off menu item a,so cooked perfectly. My only regret is that we didn’t allow for enough time to have dessert!"

"December 25, 2012",50,Awesome Steaks,"Best Steaks in town. The service was awesome. The food is always plentiful and within our budget. No matter where else we go to eat, we end up back at Smith & Wollensky's realizing we should always come here first."

"March 27, 2012",30,"Great location, but not as good as its NY and Miami restaurants","Nice place, good location on the Chicago River--which view only works in the day time and if you sit on the terrace. Service is perfunctory, wine list mediocre, and the steaks and side dishes are average, and not as good as the S&W in NYC."

"March 2, 2012",50,Like meat and good food. Eat here in Chicago,Ate in the grill. Had a burger and girlfriend had a steak. It was her first time here and she loved it. Wish they had a more extensive wine list..other than that was great. Great service. The manager checked on us twice. Nice guy!

"February 18, 2012",40,Busy but always a sure bet for steaks,"Centrally located, this spot sees plenty of professionals enjoying a hearty dinner. The ambience is elegant and sophisticated, the food impeccably cooked and presented, the service attend and unobtrusive. Steaks are of outstanding quality.

"October 24, 2011",50,Great food and Service,We had a party of ten. Most had steak or seafood; one person order lamb. We all loved our meals. The seafood appetizer was great and easily served four or five people. The price was also very good when compared to similar high end steakhouses.

"August 4, 2007",20,"Go for the atmosphere, but get your steak ANYwhere else!","We chose this restaurant for our anniversary because it was a beautiful evening and we wanted to dine outdoors. S&W is on the Chicago River with a gorgeous view. We were led to a table on the patio as we had requested - so far so good. After greeting us and bringing our cocktails, our waiter, who seemed frustrated with some other tables, made a comment about being ""almost done with school and will then come back and burn this place to the ground."" We laughed at the joke but were taken aback. We both ordered filets done medium, but mine showed up bleeding and my husband's was well-done. We flagged down the maitre 'd who apologized and had them replaced. He offered complementary dessert and after-dinner drinks for our trouble. My steak came back still quite rare but I wanted to just eat it since we were starving by then. My husband's was OK but mine was so gristley that the manager just looked at my leftovers, apologized again and said it too would be on the house. The worst part was that the steak had no real ""meat"" flavor. I had read someone else's review that used that statement and had no idea what they could have meant until now! On the positive side, the wine steward recommended a well-priced and absoluely wonderful bottle of red wine (Ottimano Zinfandel) and probably single-handedly saved our evening. We also LOVED the potatoes - buttery and spicy hashed browns. Two out of five stars."
"August 4, 2007",10,If it wasn't on the river in Chicago...............,"THIS STEAK HOUSE WOULDN'T MAKE IT! My Husband and I are native Chicagoans plus we have dined in almost every steak house in Chicago and the U.S., and this has been the worst for service and quality of our steaks, etc...... First, let me say we were treating my Brother for his Birthday and while making the reservation I asked that they bring a small piece of cake with a candle in it to our table, and I also reminded them of this before we were seated, and during our meal, and with all of that they still forgot to bring anything to our table! From the time we were seated I have to say our service was not only slow but unprofessional and just not as polished as it is in most of the steakhouses that I've been to like Gibson's, Ruths Chris, Capital Grill, Flemings, Emeril's or the Rosebud Steakhouse in Chicago which was wonderful! Our steaks which we requested ""medium"" arrived a good ""medium well"" dry and not hot the way a steak should arrive at your table. The sides were nothing special. The main dining room is very noisy since it's attached to the bar area which allows smoking and the outside veranda that seems to attract a large after work crowd because of the location on the river. If you're looking for a really good steak in a quiet relaxing atmosphere with good service and no cigar smoke while you're dining -- don't go here!"
"June 18, 2007",40,Fantastic Steak - The best by Far,"What an amazing restaurant, the ambience was incredible and its location suburb next to the Chicago River. We found this restaurant quite by chance during a stroll along State Street mid afternoon, the outside patio overlooking the River beckoned us and we stopped for drinks and nibbles. We were so impressed by the level of service that we booked a table for dinner that evening. The New York Strip steak was incredibly tender (all meat is butchered on site) and cooked to perfection. It is slightly more expensive than some other restaurants but I have to say it was the best steak I have ever tasted and defiantly worth every penny!!!"
"September 17, 2006",40,Met my expectations,"After years of seeing their advertisements in my travel and food magazines, I had a chance to splurge and have lunch at Smith and Wollensky. I was not disappointed.  I was promptly seated on the lovely, flowery outdoor patio and offered a beverage. I chose the house white wine, neither too dry nor too fruity, at $7. A basket of breads was delivered, a mix of sourdough, pretzel bread and a fabulous flat bread with sesame and fennel seeds. With it came a small dish of butter AND a butter-whole grain mustard blend. Delicious! I opted for the shrimp bisque, which was sublime, with just a whisper of red pepper ($9), followed by the lump crab appetizer, served with a delicate ginger-wasabi dipping sauce ( $15, as my entree). Yes, it was expensive for lunch, but everything was so fresh and delicious. They have nice salads, fish, beef and pork selections on the menu, and one ""regular"" seated near me said they have ""the best burger in the city"".  The service is what you are paying for here. There is a chap who takes your order, another who delivers it and serves you and yet another who delivers the bill at the end. The only reason I didn't give this place a perfect review is that one of the hosts was a bit snobby to me as I had just come from a long walk around the city and was casually dressed (but not in shorts and white tennies). Everyone else was great and didn't seem to mind that I wasn't in my Sunday best. I'd eat there again in a heartbeat."
"April 9, 2006",20,Expensive and not friendly,Our hotel concierge called for a reservation for us very early on a Saturday evening but when we got to the reatuarant and asked for a window seat in either the upstairs restaurant or the downstairs grill we were told there was nothing available - even though there were only two tables occupied near the windows on each level. We finally chatted with the host enough to get a table with partial water view (one of us could see some water and one looked at a stone wall). Throughout our entire meal no one occupied any of the window tables. The salad was huge and could have been easily shared. It would have been nice if the server had mentioned that. The food was good but very overpriced. The service was okay although somewhat distracted and more so as the restaurant got busier. This is not a restaurant we would return to when we visit Chicago again.

We all enjoyed it and were very full .."
"October 6, 2018",30,Birthday dinner,"I came to this restaurant for my boyfriend’s birthday. I was very excited to come here after all the five stars reviews but my experience wasn’t a five star one. When we were seated two flies came out from the chair and we thought that maybe was a matter of the moment. We had the same two flies on our table the entire time...pretty gross...then I went to the salad bar and saw another small fly around... to add to my bad luck I found an eyelash stuck in my mozzarella piece of cheese. I couldn’t believe all that was going on, I tried to enjoy the food but trying to keep the flies away from it was extra work I didn’t need. I mentioned it to the server and he offered to switch us to another table but we didn’t want to make a big deal after we were almost done eating anyways. The hostess and the server saw the flyers bothering us from the moment we sat down and tried to ignore the situation. My boyfriend was disappointed that we only got the same 3 types of steaks coming over and over and of course chicken and lamb. I don’t know if this place was having a bad day or what but for how expensive it is they shouldn’t have flies or an eyelash on their cheese. I’m still in shock. I came to this place because I had an awesome experience at ZED once and was hoping for the same type of experience. Will not return or recommend."

"September 29, 2018",50,DElicious,"I must say the decorations in the restaurant were cute. The space felt big and wine celler looked cool. Where do I even begin? Our server was ok, I think he was having rough day but another girl, Carol (or Karoll?), made it better. Although our words were limited she understood what I was asking and relayed it to our server and even sometimes got it herself. The black bean stew and rice was a good dish, didn't expect the pork in it but was still yummy. The lentils soup wasn't too bad either but the best parts was the meat cutter. Gacho chefs, if i'm not mistaken, they had 12 cuts and were all delicious. I love the top sirloin cut, that was my favorite. Put some of the chimichurrri on it and AHmazing. Then onto desserts! My favorite was the cream of papaya which Carol (or Karoll) recommended because she like it too. All around we enjoyed ourselves and my guest felt satisfied. Thank you and thank you to Carol (or Karoll)."
"September 25, 2018",50,"Delicious food, fantastic service","Everything about this restaurant is perfect; from the general manager, who welcomed us upon our arrival to the restaurant, to the wait staff, especially Vicky and Liz, who kept our plates and glasses full, and of course, to the drinks and food, caipirinhas that taste like Brazil, the large salad bar fit to satisfy carnivores and vegetarians alike, the side dishes that complement the meal, the deliciously cooked meats, the tasty desserst... yummy!

"September 19, 2018",30,Great but,Great food at a premium price but way to much time spent on upselling In my opinion way too much pressure on people just wanting dinner who have already had sticker shock arrogance with customers can often create a bigger check but never leads to recurring visits

"January 20, 2016",50,Second Best Steak I've ever had.,There is not a better steak in Chicago. I lived on Michigan ave. for 18 months and tried most of the famous steakhouses in Chicago. This was the best one that I went to.
"February 2, 2016",30,Very Pricey & Business Only,I went here to meet a friend of mine for dinner. There was nothing but people in suits & I was told everyone here was on an expense account which I was not. I felt that it was very highly priced for moderate food. I...More
"February 1, 2016",40,Date night with the Mrs.,My wife and I went to Chicago Cut for a date night. It was a gorgeous day so we sat outside on the patio. Everything was great from the staff to the cocktails to the steaks themselves. A very solid service all around and what better to go with it than wonderful views of the Chicago river and surroundings.
"January 31, 2016",30,Up and down,Friendly and helpful service bordering on the formal side of things. Several of the table were very pleased with their food but mine - on the bone rump - was disappointing. I normally like a rare steak but given the expected size I went medium rare. However the meat was very chewy and sinewy indeed rather than marbling melting in the mouth and the fat on the outside had not rendered down. Would expect more for a $60 piece of meat. I can only think something went wrong with mine; I would have said something but group environment did not lend itself to that. Given past reviews I guess it was an anomaly.
"January 24, 2016",30,Beautiful spot on the Chicago River but...,"Last night we celebrated our anniversary with our children at Chicago Cut. The restaurant is on the Chicago River and the massive windows give way to a beautiful views of the city. We had a cocktail in the bar until our table was ready. The bar is great with lots of tables and cozy places to sit. The main dining area for the restaurant is a massive room giving the feel of a banquet center (a sea of humanity). The perimeter of the room are only four top tables and larger groups are seated in the center area. We had requested a cozy table but instead our party of six was seated on a main walk way with other guest, waiters and staff bustling by.  We ordered wine and a few appetizers to start. I requested small plates and we would share the various appetizers. They arrived already plated with a portion of each of our selections on six plates. Not everyone wanted every appetizer. I chose not to mention my disappointment. Our waiter immediately showed up and wanted our main course selections. I requested that he return later so we could enjoy our appetizers and mentioned that we were not in a hurry. Before I could finish the appetizer our table was being cleared. Again I mentioned we were not in a hurry.  The appetizers, entrees and side dishes we ordered we presented nicely. The crab cake appetizer was not the best. The delicate crabmeat was overpowered by too many red peppers. The sides are very small serving intended for one person. I personally had the lamb chops and they were excellent.  If you are looking for the traditional old style Chicago steak house this is not my favorite. I also suggest not driving to the restaurant because the valet parking is very unorganized. Take an Uber or LYFT."
"January 20, 2016",50,Second Best Steak I've ever had.,There is not a better steak in Chicago. I lived on Michigan ave. for 18 months and tried most of the famous steakhouses in Chicago. This was the best one that I went to.
"January 14, 2016",50,Excellent Late Night Food and Service,"We returned to Chicago Cut Steakhouse late in the evening after the opera, wanting a late night snack. The service was attentive and warm. My hamburger and fries were marvelous. The Caprese salad hit the spot. Wonderful breadbasket. Drinks extremely well prepared. The Breckenridge whiskey exceeded expectations. View of the Chicago River and the elevated trains traveling over the bridge is iconic."
"January 6, 2016",40,needs a little work,"Arrived as 3 and waiting for 4th. Wouldn't seat us even though there were only 4 tables occupied. Then when 4th arrived a few minutes later took us to a table next to one of the 4 occupied ones, and where one person had pushed so far away from their table they were blocking one of our seats. Hostess didn't seem to care, but we asked for a different table, which was next to windows---very nice. Food good with large portions. Waitress was excellent. Large portions. Very attentive without being intrusive. Did I mention large portions.  If the arrival experience set a better feel, this is easily a top restaurant and being on the river--will have a great Spring through Fall view."
"January 3, 2016",40,"Dinner with my son, 50/50","I'll start by saying I WILL return. The service was exceptional, excellent location, decor and view. The lobstercargo app was so good! The steaks is where 50/50 came in. My bone in prime was astounding. Cooked to perfection at medium rare. My sons medium filet was rare. Returned to be cooked to order and came back a charred mess. They promptly removed from my bill and apologized profusely. No ones perfect, I understand and don't hold this against them. The a la cattle sides of scalloped and whipped potatoes were delightful. Drinks were poured heavy and they do bourbon right with large sphere ice. Dessert was complimentary and very good as well.  An ""almost"" perfect meal, maybe next time as we will return based on service and the majority positive experience with our visit."
"January 3, 2016",50,"Another Chicago jewel and a ""Cut above the rest""","We love to enjoy fine dining when we visit Chicago and this restaurant is one of the BEST Each time we visit Chicago we choose another great place to eat this time it was Chicago Cut Steakhouse We read a lot of reviews before selecting a place and every review was right on for this one From the polite and courteous person we spoke to when making a reservation ,the easy cab ride and convenient location,and walking in we were greeted like family. The decor was luxurious and nothing but class. We were seated in a very timely manner. The staff were professional and offered great advice on the huge wine list and food specials available.

The prices were comparable with any great Chicago restaurant and we will be back here again for sure. A big thank you for everyone at Chicago Cut for a wonderful dining experience."
"December 29, 2015",50,Wow what an amazing meal,"We came here for a family meal to celebrate an early Christmas. We were blown away by that amazing staff. The food was beyond amazing. 3 of us had the filet which was to die for. The other two had the 32 oz prime rib and said it was the best they've ever had. Also, had the Mac and cheese side and really enjoyed it. For dessert we had the chocolate cake and loved every bite. Really a nice restaurant for a special evening"

"June 13, 2018",50,Party of 14,"On business, had 14 for dinner at Joe’s and unfortunately only 10 showed. That didn’t waiver the great service of Colleen and team Joe’s! Amazing meals - covering just about every corner of the menu. Steaks, seafood (including crab claws), salads etc. All the guests...More"
"June 12, 2018",50,Wonderful Lunch Spot,"My husband and I just celebrated our anniversary. We decided to go to Joe's to have a late lunch. We requested and were accommodated with a quiet corner booth. Our server, Ryan, was absolutely awesome. He was attentive and well informed, warm and friendly. The food, as usual, was delicious. We had the tuna tartar (always a go-to), filet, New York strip and asparagus. All were cooked to perfection. The service is always top notch; the atmosphere is delightful and we will continue to return. It is just a lovely place to have a meal - lunch or dinner - it's always a treat."
"June 10, 2018",40,Wonderful but expensive food,"We went here for a drink and some appetizers before going to the Blues Festival this weekend and enjoyed the experience. My wife had a scotch on the rocks (nice scotch and bourbon, etc list) and I had some wine. We shared the crab cake and Joe's chopped salad. Th food was very good, but as expected, expensive. The service was good, as was the atmosphere."
"June 10, 2018",40,So busy you have to walk sideways to make it to the restroom!,"I guess if you like crab, this is the place. I tasted it and confirmed the fact,it was average and if this was supposed to be special, I can continue to pass especially at the cost of this plate. Now onto GREAT waiter, one of the best. Despite the crowd, we had a quiet corner table ( guess you need to get there at 4:15 like we did (with reservations) Dinner was good and each of us enjoyed it. Would I recommend, no, but as you walked sideways and had to move around waiters to exit...nobody needs my opinion...."
"June 10, 2018",50,So happy we went here,"This is always on our list when we visit Chicago but it's always too full by the time we realize we want to go. We got lucky that there was a local sports team playing that night and we were able to get a table on the day of.  We were there with another couple and our 18 month old son. He was well behaved based on his standards but still threw a few things here and there the staff didn't mind at all and actually seemed like they enjoyed having a baby in the restaurant. I wouldn't normally recommend taking young kids here but we had no other choice as out of townies.  The food is amazing, we had so many different things from the menu because we wanted to try them all including the Chicken which was great. Anything seafood including the stone crab is amazing, you can order anything and not go wrong. Definitely will visit again when I'm back in Chicago."
"June 8, 2018",40,Great food!,"My friend ate the stone crabs and said they were fantastic. I had a steak and key lime pie. Beyond delicious and the service was perfect! If you want a reliably good meal, check this place out!"
"June 7, 2018",50,Fresh seafood and friendly atmosphere,"At 5:30pm on a Thursday, this restaurant was already packed with no open tables. I happily sat in the front area of the restaurant along the side to people-watch by myself. I enjoyed The Whale appetizer with a sampling of chilled seafood and medium sized stone crabs (larger sizes available). I didn't expect to, but ended up having wonderful conversation with ladies sitting on either side of me who were also dining alone. My tip for you is that the seafood salad and pies are available in half portions, though it is not mentioned in the menu. They must be known for their pies...I tried half a slice of coconut cream pie with a cappuccino and it was very tasty. My meal, with ice tea, was very pricy so be prepared for that, but the food was delicious."
"June 6, 2018",40,"still high food quality, service not on the same level","Very good bar service in the foyer, like always excellent quality of the srandard dishes, especially the alaskan king crab which is always a highlight and the signature steaks. Service was not on the same level, they forgot the dessert from two of us - maybe intentionally because it was 11:30 p.m. - but they could have told us."
"June 5, 2018",40,Pricy but good seafood,"Great service, super fresh seafood, nice atmosphere.

"May 20, 2018",50,"Love the oyster, jumbo shrimp","It is a little pricy but worth it. Oysters are fresh and delicious. I would also recommend the lobsters. Stone crabs taste good but I wont order it again, its a bit overpriced."
"May 20, 2018",50,This place is amazing!,"Loved everything about Joe’s! Excellent service from our fun and helpful hostess Kaleen, beautiful stone crab claws and seafood platter and good value for the quality of food we had. Plus lovely atmosphere and old-worldly charm....Chicago is so lucky!"

"September 29, 2014",50,one of my favorites,The food and service are the best. We have never had a bad meal. The only problem is getting a reservation on the weekends....it has become nearly impossible and because of this we don't go as often as we would like. Highly recommend!

"September 23, 2014",50,One of my favorites in Chicago,We had a group of 24 in the boardroom and the food and service was great. When you order the seafood platter they serve portions to each guest. This is much classier than the standard towers set in the middle of the tables.
"September 16, 2014",50,Delicious food and extraordinary service,"As always Jose's serves great food. My wife and I asked for items on the menu we have not had before and all was great.

"August 22, 2014",50,A Great SteakHouse,"Staff was excellent, great service is expected at this place and they won't let you down. Ribeye was prepared to perfection, and the keylime pie was as close to kelime in Savannah as you will find."

"August 3, 2014",50,Top Notch,"Excellent lunch. Service terrific; attentive without hovering. Pricey, but terrific food. Seafood salad very good. Dr. Bob's turkey burger, with avocado; french fried sweets; delicious. Recommended."
"August 3, 2014",50,Reserve Your Table and Enjoy!,Joe's Seafood is best known for its Stone Crab. The restaurant began in Miami on South Beach and low has locations in Chicago and Washington DC. The Chicago location provided the best service I've experienced in a large restaurant setting.
"August 3, 2014",40,Great food and experience,This restaurant came highly recommended and didn't disappoint. The crabs and seafood were superb and the service was faultless. We had a little wait for our table and the tables were tightly packed together but the experience was worth it.

"July 28, 2014",50,For seafood lovers,"Although Joe's is part of a restaurant chain, originally from Miami, the service and food feel like unique. The scallops with pork belly and the king crab paired with white wine were absolutely delicious- I highly recommend this restaurant-"
"July 24, 2014",40,Very good stone crab and top-shelf service,Enjoyed a very satisfying lunch. Crab is their forte. Creamed spinach was yummy but not special. Hash browns were completely unremarkable. Side salad was very good as was the breadbasket. Very refined and attentive service. Delicious crab. Pricey.
"July 21, 2014",50,As always great,Joe's is always a good idea. We had the stone crabs which are always great and fresh. Even the french fries were crunchy and fried to perfection. Don't miss it if you're in Chicago or Miami.
"July 20, 2014",50,Highly recommend!,Great seafood and steaks. Service was top notch! Upbeat atmosphere. Reservations recommended! Centrally located.
"July 15, 2014",50,Always delicious at Joe's,Every time we visit Chicago we dine at Joe's. It is consistently great. Staff is always friendly and accommodating. Had a great seafood salad for lunch. Burger is always good.
"July 6, 2014",30,Too expensive and service is average,I ordered crab and soup. The soup was very salty and the crab does not have the taste of crab I expected. The service is average and expected to get more than 18% tip. Not worth the money.
"July 15, 2014",40,We'll earned reputation,"If you're wanting typical American seafood and beef,then this is the place to come,where tradition,service,and good portions all combine to give us customers even more than we expect,assuming,like us, it's your 1st time there. Fantastic pure crab cake,and a portion easily shared,then a prawn dish,coated...More"
"July 14, 2014",50,Great place to eat,"My husband and I were visiting Chicago recently and heard about Joe's from my parents who have been to the ones in FL and Vegas. The seafood and steaks were to die for. Steve B., our waiter, answered all our questions and was attentive to our needs. You definitely need a reservation as the place fills quickly. A bit on the expensive side but well worth it. Not a place you can go do all the time but definitely worth going to."
"July 13, 2014",50,Outstanding Service and Food,We went here for the first time and thought this is how a restaurant should be for our meal is one that we will remember for a long time and Charles our server was probably the best server that we have had the pleasure to serve us. They have a bar waiting area so you can get a drink and pass the time until your table comes up and I would advise everyone to call and make a reservation. I would say anything you order here will delight your tatesbuds and have you coming here again once you arrive back in Chicago.
"July 12, 2014",40,Late Lunch,"My family and I stopped in for a late lunch on a Friday. The menu is extensive with a wide range of food choices. They also have a section called classics, which is three courses at a reduced cost. All of our meals were very good, from crispy fish tacos to filet mignon to lobster bisque. As far as must tries; Joe's cole slaw prepared at your table, spinach stuffed mushroom caps, lobster bisque, key lime pie and peanut butter cream pie. The final cost for four of us, with no alcohol, but four deserts and 3 lattes was $135.00."
"July 11, 2014",50,Great food and service,"I have been to the Joe's in Vegas. This was better food and service than there. Our waitress was great !!!! It was my birthday so she brought me a free key lime pie. I had the fresh catch, it was one of the best piece of fish I ever had eaten. I eat seafood often. The salad and bread was also great.  Joe's is a great place. It maybe a little pricey, but it's well worth it."
"July 10, 2014",30,Seafood left me underwhelmed,"i had great expectations for this place. From the moment I stepped in, I was impressed with the decor and service of the front desk and waiter staff. The wine list and menu offer a great choice. The wine list is extensive and offers a wide choice for all budgets. The appetizer was great. But at the end of the day, one lives and dies by the main dish. The main dish was sole. I tried it to compare them to my wife's sole dish that is virtually the same. The difference being that my wife's is better. The sole dish was bit flat on the flavor profile and dry. It was good, but not great. And at a place like this, one expects great."
"July 8, 2014",50,Great seafood and service,"My husband and I were invited to a birthday celebration here, and we're very glad to try this excellent restaurant. Think classic clubby seafood and steaks and try their cold stone crab claws, which were delicious. There are several complimentary bread options, quite tasty. I try crab cakes at every seafood place, and these were excellent, no creative sauce, but tender, flaky, and delicious. The special watermelon and feta salad was a delicious refreshing option for a summer dinner. My husband loved his ribeye. Male family members all loved their steaks and we women all loved our seafood. Save room for the pies, which are fantastic and can be ordered in half slice options. My favorite was the Key lime, which had just the right balance of tartness and sweetness, followed by the banana cream. Havana, chocolate, peanut butter, and cherry were also popular at our table. Service was excellent and prices reasonable for Chicago, but not cheap. We would return."
"July 8, 2014",40,food was excellent but way overpriced,"The food was excellent, service was excellent, but honestly even the best steak and crab legs can only be so great. Our bill for 4 people was 400.00 and that included only 2 glasses of wine. I cannot say anything bad about the place, only that I wouldnt go back due to the expense. I could hav bought a weeks worth of groceries for the same price and I honestly felt guilty for spending that much on a meal."
"July 7, 2014",50,Wonderful personal service,"Went here for the espresso martinis once & for a fabulous lunch during this trip. Our lunch was an assortment of small plates & several were special ordered to accomodate a vegan so we could all share. Everything came as ordered & never felt like we were being to picky. Everything we ate, was delicious!"
"July 6, 2014",30,Too expensive and service is average,I ordered crab and soup. The soup was very salty and the crab does not have the taste of crab I expected. The service is average and expected to get more than 18% tip. Not worth the money.
"July 3, 2014",50,Fantastic Restaurant,Will definitely be back. The Dover Sole was amazing. The staff was great!!! Make reservations far in advance.
"June 30, 2014",40,Good but pricey,"The staff were great, the ambience was wonderful and the food very good but pricey when you consider that all the sides are priced separately."

"June 26, 2013",50,The very best,I enjoyed a wonderful meal last night at Joe's. Their Dover Sole might be the best I have ever had and I order it whenever it's on a menue. The service was outstanding. If I lived in Chicago I would dine here often.
"June 25, 2013",50,Magnificent,"Oh my goodness... Heaven! Everything we ordered was top-shelf - tender, delicious calamari (we think the best we've ever had and we're tried it everywhere); sweet, succulent lobster; and, both tuna and steak like butter. It was a perfect choice for a birthday dinner!"
"June 12, 2013",50,Good but noisy,"my first time trying stone crab. it was ok. went on a saturday night, so it was very busy. obviously the restaurant is going to be loud. but the service was excellent. the joes scallops were awesome."
"June 18, 2013",50,Classy and Delicious!,You have to make reservations because this restaurant is busy. It is very beautiful inside and all of the staff is dressed elegantly. My waitor was in a blak and white suit. I saw some people dressed more casual but I would not feel comfortable...More
"June 18, 2013",50,Shell out for this one!,"I attended a business dinner in a private room here. We had a fixed menu with pre-selected appetizers. Wow! The platters of crab were absolutely mouthwateringly incredible. And then they brought the second platter of crab! I had the crabcakes as an entree and the house salad. Servings were large, and I was definitely full before the dessert. I will definitely come back to this place to try the steak."
"June 17, 2013",50,Why is a 6 rating not possible...,"Came in on the Saturday to ask for a table, earliest was the Monday at 8.30pm which we took. (Book early!!) When we arrived, we were shown our table and given an extensive wine list and menu. Ordered the 20oz ribeye with bone in, my Mother had the Lobster Tempura, along with baked potato and broccoli. I asked the waiter (Jeff) to select a red wine for myself as I don't really know about wines, the one he selected was excellent and far from the most expensive glass! The steak I had was one of the best i've ever had, the flavour was simply epic! The other thing which really surprised us both was the speed at which our food was prepared. Within 10-15 minutes we had our meals on our table. I was absolutely astounded! They certainly have a lot of staff on the restaurant floor and must have an incredible amount behind the scenes! If you're looking for a special occasion, this is the place! Really, really looking forward to coming back the next time i'm in Chicago, the city should be proud of this restaurant!"
"June 17, 2013",50,Best restaurant in Chicago,"Whenever I visit Chicago, I love to eat here. I cannot thing of anything that is not fantastic.  Halibut & Mahi - they prepare this perfectly. The best I have ever tasted. Their seafood blows away any other restaurant I have been to.  Jenny's Mashed Potatoes - delicious with a wonderful topping.  Onion straws - as good as the one's in Cape Cod.  Calamari - very good also.  Bread - they bring out an assortment of about 6 different breads. Very fresh.  Desserts - Peppermint Ice Cream with hot fudge sauce, banana cream pies and key lime pie were fantastic.  Service - excellent.  Keep up the great work."
"June 16, 2013",50,Great food and service. Make a reservation!,"Thankfully I made reservations. We arrived about 30 minutes early thinking we'd get a drink or two at the bar or get seated early - that was not going to happen. After about 10 minutes we finally could get up to the bar! The bartenders were great and shared all of their favorites with us which helpful since so many things sounded tasty. Knowing I wanted to try the blueberry pie (IT WAS AWESOME!), we didn't bother with apps or salad. I had the bone in halibut special, huge portion but wonderful. My husband had the 20oz bone in ribeye, a good steak. We split the garlic spinach and a half order of the corn - get the corn! With the no room we had left, we got half portions of the blueberry and Boston cream pies. We were also given a slice of their key lime pie. The chocolate was a bit too heavy for the Boston cream pie. I'd come back here just for the blueberry pie."
"June 15, 2013",40,Solo lunch consoling/reviving,"When I said I was there for a consolation lunch, the maitre d' said, You're never alone at Joe's, and Where better to be consoled? And so it was--excellent friendly service, best salmon burger I've ever had (little if any filler, pickled cucumbers and dill sauce to accompany it), choice of side--and I had sweet potato fries, always a favorite. I can't wait to go back and have the chopped seafood salad, another favorite. In fact, I left my credit card behind, requiring a really rapid return!"
"June 12, 2013",50,Good but noisy,"my first time trying stone crab. it was ok. went on a saturday night, so it was very busy. obviously the restaurant is going to be loud. but the service was excellent. the joes scallops were awesome."
"June 11, 2013",50,"Great food, great service!",We enjoyed our meal at Joe's as the menu has tons of choices. The calamari was crispy and light. The crab cake was delicious as well. The tuna tartare was tasty but the temperature was not as cold as it should have been. The seafood chopped salad was nice but didn't have as much seafood as I thought it would. The crab bisque is delicious and the crab legs were fabulous. The grilled corn was delicious but the lyonnaise potatoes were just okay. They gave us a piece of key lime pie for absolutely not reason at all (nice surprise) and it was tart and tasty. The Havana pie was to die for. You have to try it. Great meal!
"June 9, 2013",50,Alaskan King Crab Legs,"My husband and I had dinner here for our anniversary. We are very picky eaters. He had the Chilean Sea Bass and I had the Alaskan King Crab Legs. First off the food was excellent, the waiter was great and the ambiance was nice too.  The crab legs were fantastic-they crack them for you table side and you can enjoy them with no work and no mess. They were exactly what I had hoped for. Excellent!  We made reservations over a month ahead of time on open table. As for attire, I wore jeans and a nice top. We like places where we are able to get excellent but simple foods and can get away with jeans. I would consider this a very nice dinner (far better than your average-great steak house but not a five star restaurant offering a 7 course tasting menu)."
"June 3, 2013",50,Excellent - top to bottom,"We went for lunch over Memorial Day weekend and had a great time. We arrived fairly early (11:35am) on a Saturday so there was not much of a crowd at that point. I started off with a bloody mary based upon the several drinks that were being mixed at the bar when we walked in. It was excellent and pleasantly spicy (and the blue cheese-stuffed olive was a nice touch). To start, our waiter was outstanding and very helpful. We started with a Caesar salad, crab cakes, and an enormous grilled shrimp from the “specials” menu (Madagascar Shrimp). The shrimp was remarkably tender and grilled perfectly – and, as advertised, huge. The crab cake was not as large as I had hoped for, but there were large whole chunks of very fresh crab and it was very good as well. We had stone crab, copper salmon and halibut for entrees and each was excellent, although stone crab and halibut were probably slightly ahead of the salmon which were very small for the price. Just to be gluttons, we also went with the key lime pie and the strawberry/rhubarb pie: both were excellent. The key lime was perfectly tart (not too sweet at all) and there were large “rough-cuts” from the rhubarb stalk versus the typical fruit puree is found in too many pies.  Overall, while expensive, this was an excellent meal and worthy of all of the accolades found on the other Trip Advisor comments."
"May 29, 2013",50,Great place!,The great service is the first thing you notice. Roc was our waiter I always remember the names of the good one's. The food was presented and cooked very well. I will return.
"May 28, 2013",50,Very Special Memory!,"We walked in and we were treated royally. The food was excellent as was the service. What a first class establishment. We ate a late lunch and it wasn't busy. Everything was wonderful, drinks, appetizer, meals, and dessert!"
"May 27, 2013",50,Wonderful meal,"Another family celebration was a wonderful meal at Joe's. Alaskan crab and calamari for appetizers were perfect. Our steaks, sides and desserts perfect. Another wonderful meal at Joe's. it is my boys favorite restaurant !"
"May 24, 2013",50,Bring your business group here,"This place is always bustling. Yet, the service is always great. Big groups get a menu with many choices. Food great, huge portions. Bill is always LESS than expected."
"May 24, 2013",40,Very good restaurant with great service and atmosphere,Had a very good lunch in this busy and lively restaurant. We did not have a reservation but were fitted in on bar stools by the window. Great service and atmosphere. Enjoyed a long lunch with background jazz music. Recommended
"May 18, 2013",50,Worth every penny.,"Expensive, but not too bad at lunch. The crab claws are a must. The service was excellent. Good decor and attention to detail."
"May 14, 2013",50,Wow!,"I went with a very large group. Every ordered something different - fish, poultry, meat choices. Every person raved about their meal. I LOVED the crunchy on the outside, silky on the inside crab cakes. TIP: Dessert servings are super-sized. Plan on sharing.... (or not!)"
"May 3, 2013",40,Good not great,"First night in Chicago, we were recommended to go to joes buzzing place, food good not great for price! However lobster cooked perfectly"
"May 3, 2013",40,Best steak I've ever tasted; went in 2009 and still as good in 2013.,"5 of us went for lunch and all of us highly rated the experience. Excellent quality food, steaks out of this world. Great value for money and worth every penny. Perfect."
"April 30, 2013",40,Good Seafood,"We stopped for lunch and had an excellent seafood salad. The service was great, with the diet cokes being refilled before we knew it. A very enjoyable experience."
"April 24, 2013",50,Wonderful Food!,Fabulous food and evironment. Ordered the crusted halibut and several side dishes for a party of six...everyone thought there dishes were top notch. The environment is great with appropriate noise level and lighting. Would highly recommend.

"March 18, 2013",50,Fun with great seafood,"Highly recommend this place. A liitle noisey, but so what.. Crab cakes are super. Waiter very attentive. Easy location to get to."
"March 12, 2013",50,THE BEST CRAB CLAWS I EVER HAD !!!,"If you are a seafood lover and can afford a 200$ dinner for two, you should defiantly put this one on your restaurant bucket list !!! The Crab claws are awesome but you also have to try the Jenny's potatoes on the side !"
"March 7, 2013",50,Enjoyed tremendously!,Went over last weekend. First time in Chicago and Joe's was delicious. Pricey for me but its what I was there to do. Huge crab legs. Excellent service and a free dessert for my anniversary. Top notch.

"March 7, 2013",50,Always top notch food & service,"You play, you pay my daddy always said, & Joe's is no exception. At least you get delicious food and top service. Reservations a must, but we like the bar area best. Turns out not affiliated with Miami Joe's, in name & menu only."
"March 6, 2013",50,Go for the stone crab,"Pricey, but won't disappoint. Everything is ala-carte so it's pricy, but the stone crab is to die for. I have not had a bad meal here - average price per person is about $60"
"March 5, 2013",30,Another great experience at Joes.,"The food was delicious. Our waiter, David, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the various food flavors, and was a very professional waiter. Tremendously good experience! Would highly recommend it!!"
"February 26, 2013",50,stone crab!,"As usual, a great meal at Joes. The stone crab claws were great and our lunch meals were excellent. I would highly recommend joes for lunch or dinner."
"February 24, 2013",50,Dinner with the Wife,This restaurant was great. The wait staff was prompt and attentive. The food was perfect. We were there almost two hours and never felt rushed. Make reservations! We booked about 4-5 days in advance and could not get a seating between 5pm - 10pm.
"February 17, 2013",50,The best steak,We dined at the Joe's and were delighted to see friendly and knowledgeable staff. The staek was simply amazing and the coleslaw to-die-for! Probably the best prime steak I have ever had.
"February 14, 2013",40,Eat in the Bar,"I'm sure the dining room is nice, but we've forgone the wait and eaten at the high-top bar tables several times and had fun! The Crab bisque is awesome, the service is good, and all the entrees were excellent."

"January 13, 2013",40,NRA Show time at Joe's!,"It was a Friday, the wait a little longer than our reservation but worth it. The Stone Crabs were just in season and spectacular. The steaks were decent, not the best and by far not the worst. A good restaurant. 4 out of 5 stars."
"January 9, 2013",50,great steaks,"amazingly good but expensive, worth it but expensive. I had an aged steak and I think it was 75 bucks just for the steak. But, worth it"

"July 29, 2011",50,As Good As Miami,"Just as good as the Miami original. Cole slaw is exactly the same, the stone crabs are just as good. The sea bass in miso was a hit, as was the key lime pie for dessert. Steve was an excellent waiter."

My first trip to Joe's came when my parents took me in 1955, and no matter how many times I've returned, it remains the same five-star establishment. It's only open seasonally - when the stone crabs are availiable, so be sure to check before you go. Don't miss the wonderful bread (the only thing missing from the Chicago location), the browned potatoes - and the key lime pie is extrodinary.

The restaurant in Chicago pretends to be a high-class steak and seafood house, but there are some problems. First, although I had a reservation (which they confirmed by phone TWICE), we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. I find that inexcusable, and by the time we were seated we were already in a bad mood: What's the point of making and confirming a reservation if it wont be honored? Second, the food was really average: my colleague's fish was plain grilled, my crab claws did NOT taste fresh, the salad was plain old lettuce in a bowl, the wine pours were short, about 4oz, and they hold the food to see if you'll order another glass. The only good part of the meal was the key lime pie (great crust). Our service was fine, but nothing special. For a $175.00 meal for 2, I was not impressed and would not go again."

My first trip to Joe's came when my parents took me in 1955, and no matter how many times I've returned, it remains the same five-star establishment. It's only open seasonally - when the stone crabs are availiable, so be sure to check before you go. Don't miss the wonderful bread (the only thing missing from the Chicago location), the browned potatoes - and the key lime pie is extrodinary. All of these I've sampled in the Chicago location and except for the bread, live up to the original."
"March 9, 2006",50,Top class!,"Visited Joe's with seven business colleagues. We were all bowled over.  Extremely friendly service (led by Hank, the head waiter) and a great atmosphere. The crabs and fish are good, but take it from me that the New York strip steak is great.  Pretty good wine list, too.  I can't recommend Joe's highly enough. You can book here with total safety and will have a fabulous evening out."
"March 2, 2006",50,our best dining experience in Chicago,My husband and I went to an early dinner here. We noticed that it was the #1 restaurant listed on opentable.com. We were really impressed. Our waiter was fantastic and the food even better. We both had steaks and found them to be perfect. I ordered the apple pie for dessert....the best I have had in years. The atmosphere....and music was lovely. I can't recommend it highly enough. Perhaps after our night at Signature Room at the 95th (John Hancock center)the night before shaped our opinion a little. We were really bummed out by that experience....crappy service and food and a lot pricier. Any time we come back we are sure to revisit Joe's Seafood. It is a gem!

"October 1, 2005",50,Best seafood and steak I've found in Chicago,"This has become my favorite Chicago restaurant. It's the only place I know of that has both top notch seafood and steaks at reasonable prices. As with any establishment managed by Lettuce Entertain You, the service is excellent. The servers are extremely well versed in all aspects of the menu and wine list. I've noticed that several steak places in this area of the City (River North) serve ""choice"" steaks.. as indicated by the name not here.. don't make the mistake of overlooking the prime steaks on Joe's menu particularly the bone in selections ( the bone in filet is unbelievable). A stone crab and king crab appetizer goes extremely well with their steaks. The side dishes are large enough to split up to 4 ways. Don't miss this restaurant. You won't be disappointed"
"May 6, 2005",50,8 Thumbs Up!,"As a stone crab fan caught in NY, I had been eagerly awaiting a visit to Joe's while on a recent trip to Chicago and I was not disappointed. Our group of four were all enthusiastically in approval of both the food and the service at this restaurant.  Between us we enjoyed the stone crab, lobster tail, shrimp, and king crab legs, all of which were excellent (the steaks also have a great reputation but we were all about the seafood). The key lime pie is divine and better than anything of the many I tried while actually in Keys.  Our waitperson, Amy, was most attentive and extremely accomodating, making great recommendations & going off the printed menu to put together some combo entree plates for those of us who were incapable of deciding between all the heavenly offerings.

"June 11, 2006",20,Overblown and mediocre,"I went to the Joe's in Miami a few years ago and loved it. Since I was going to Chicago for a weekend, I thought it would be fun to try the Joe's there. The restaurant in Chicago pretends to be a high-class steak and seafood house, but there are some problems. First, although I had a reservation (which they confirmed by phone TWICE), we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. I find that inexcusable, and by the time we were seated we were already in a bad mood: What's the point of making and confirming a reservation if it wont be honored? Second, the food was really average: my colleague's fish was plain grilled, my crab claws did NOT taste fresh, the salad was plain old lettuce in a bowl, the wine pours were short, about 4oz, and they hold the food to see if you'll order another glass. The only good part of the meal was the key lime pie (great crust). Our service was fine, but nothing special. For a $175.00 meal for 2, I was not impressed and would not go again."
"April 20, 2006",40,Great food,"Visited Joes last weekend while in Chicago. 2 of us split a bone-in-filet, jennys potatos, a salad, and 6 stone crab legs. No drinks, and the bill was $110 before tip. More than one pays for a high-end meal in St. Louis, but the food was so good. Especially the crab legs. The filet was great, but I've had better for less money. Jenny's potatos were awesome.

"April 22, 2019",50,Dinner with Daughter & her Boyfriend,"My daughter made this reservation for us ~ 2+ months ago. My wife and I were visiting from Texas. I have eaten many steaks in my time and I must admit this was one of the very best. Good service, good sides, good experience."
"April 9, 2019",50,Always happy and satisfied at Bavette.,"Great steak. Great service. Lovely and professional hostesses. People have a good sense of humor. I tend to take out of country guests there, or just go with family. Mehran (of Chicago)"
"April 4, 2019",50,Great food and dining experience,Had dinner for five here on a Tuesday night. It’s tough to get a reservation but worth the effort. Seafood tower was great. Steaks were fantastic. We loved the decor and feel of the joint. Don’t settle for the chain next time in Chicago!
"March 22, 2019",50,A love child of a steakhouse and a speakeasy,Great meat experience in an atmosphere if a trendy bar. Good selection of cocktails. Love the bone marrow with steaks.
"March 19, 2019",50,Top Notch!,Best steak in the city!! Bar area is second to none. Very dim speakeasy feel. Drinks were made with precision and Flair!
"February 21, 2019",50,Fabulous,"We came for dinner after reading others reviews. Dark rooms,beautiful chandeliers,lovely bar and fantastic service"
"February 14, 2019",50,Excellent!,We dined there about 1.5 years ago and we were completely satisfied with everything. Really liked their corkage fee for BYOB: Share a glass with a neighboring table! Now that's first class! Highly recommend this restaurant.
"February 9, 2019",50,Amazing,This restaurant is really hard to ge into but worth it by far. The atmosphere is sumptuous. The dinners are excellent. The deserts are great. The service is exceptional. Best in Chicago.
"December 3, 2018",50,"Incredible Food, Cocktails, Service","Went here for a family dinner while I was in town visiting. Incredible steak, strong cocktails and outstanding service. I loved the vibe of Bavette's, too. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great steakhouse in Chicago."
"November 25, 2018",50,Dinner in heaven ?,"Surprising venue, excellent food, very good service. Still, compared to European standards prices are over the top. Glad I was here on invitation. 150$ a person is what you will spend on average."
"November 19, 2018",20,Very bad organisation,"I had a reservation for two at 7pm. The man at the entrance did not find it. Instead to apologize, he was very unfriendly. We had to wait more than 1h and had got a terrible table."
"November 12, 2018",50,Great overall experience,"Definitely make a reservation. We got extremely lucky and found a couch down in the basement to sit at. Service was terrific, food was even better. We would absolutely go back."
"October 8, 2018",50,A visit to a highly recommended place,"This is a great restaurant. Not cheap but adequate. The environment was great and even better was service. Service was harmonious, non-intrusive, pleasant. Menu and wine list are excellent. Emphasis is on meat dishes but there are alternatives, appetizers were fantastic."
"October 2, 2018",50,Best beef in the city,"We had a fantastic evening, with excellent food and wine. The interior is a must see and added to the ambiance created. The service was very good. We will definitely return again. Any of the steaks on the menu would be a great choice."
"October 21, 2018",40,Unique Ambiance with Excellent Food & Service,I’ve dined at Bavette’s many times. I enjoy the grotto-feel of the downstairs bar and dining area. It’s dark down their with romantic lighting and circular booths where couples can sit side-by-side to smooch a bit between courses. Everything on the menu is excellent. This...More
"October 14, 2018",40,"High end steakhouse, delicious food, excellent service, a bit overpriced.","I have been to amazing steakhouses all over the US, and many abroad. Every once in awhile, one will “wow” me. This one came close, but a $550 tab for four should nail it, every time. The dutchess cut filet is already served with bernaise, so ordering it “Oscar style”, gets you a few pieces of crab, no asparagus, for an additional $24. I don’t mind paying high prices in restaurants, but I do mind leaving with the feeling I’ve been “had” just a bit."
"October 11, 2018",20,Babette's bad attitude,"Great food unbelievably bad attitude..  We were seated 30 minutes after our confirmed reservation.  We were seated at a corner booth and we're shortly told repeatedly thereafter ""told we needed to immediately relocated because they had a much larger party that needed to sit in our booth""  Moved to a lesser table and watched a party a group of 4 replace our party of 3 at our original table.  Won't be going back there anytime soon  Positives-  Excellent food quality  Great service  Innovative and unique wine corkage program. No corkage fee as long as you share a glass with another table!  The conked out side dishes  Negatives  Condescending and very arrogant attitude  30 minute delay to get seated, past confirmed reservation time  There are many equal or better restaurants in close private proximity"
"October 8, 2018",50,A visit to a highly recommended place,"This is a great restaurant. Not cheap but adequate. The environment was great and even better was service. Service was harmonious, non-intrusive, pleasant. Menu and wine list are excellent. Emphasis is on meat dishes but there are alternatives, appetizers were fantastic."
"October 8, 2018",40,Great start to our Chicago trip ..,Recommended Bavettes by friends here .. It’s a huge cavern of a place .. but every table was taken . It’s quite dark inside but plays nice jazz which sets the mood .. we covered most of the menu .. highlights being the crab cakes ( amazing ) bacon and cheese salad and short rib pasta .. superb. Steak frites also gets a mention .. comes with the biggest pile of fries .. awesome. So make sure your hungry going to Bavettes .. it’s where quality and quantity rules.Comes highly recommended.. Enjoy !
"October 7, 2018",50,A Great Evening,"We were recommended this restaurant by our front desk agent at the Raddison Blu hotel. She called the restaurant for us and we were lucky enough to get a reservation since it was already past dinner time. Great ambiance, delicious steaks and top notch service. I'm glad we got to try this restaurant on our visit to Chicago."
"October 5, 2018",50,Wow!!,"Where do I start - make a reservation to avoid waiting because you will wait - we had a reservation which we made a month in advance - I call it out because the people that sat next to us had to wait two hours - so worth every penny - This meal was by far the BEST I’ve had in Chicago! The service was awesome - Thank you Meredith!! The Steak was incredible but most of all the mashed potatoes were mouth watering & to finish.....Carrot Cake was WOW!! So yummy & I will be back - do yourself a favor & try this place, you will NOT be disappointed."
"October 2, 2018",50,Best beef in the city,"We had a fantastic evening, with excellent food and wine. The interior is a must see and added to the ambiance created. The service was very good. We will definitely return again. Any of the steaks on the menu would be a great choice."
"October 2, 2018",50,Some of the Best Food in the City,"I've dined here twice. Both times it was amazing. The first time we came as walk-ins and ate at the bar. There was no shortage of great service at the bar. The Bar tender was great with suggesting food and drinks. The second visit was with a reservation after a Comedy show. Once again the food was delicious, the service excellent and the atmosphere very laid back. Definitely one of my favorite places to go in the city."
"September 27, 2018",50,Chicago’s Finest,"Most reviews have pegged Bavette’s as the best steakhouse in the Windy City, and in two words, I agree. It’s not easy being the best in the cow capital of the United States, but they have succeeded. I had been to their Vegas restaurant, but could only snag a last minute 5:30 spot for a quickly planned Chicago trip. I would have gone for breakfast. The ambiance, the filet, the truffle mac and cheese....you get the picture. Our waiter Joel was beyond compare...he made us feel like our last name was Daley. I usually take a pass when only 5 PM and 9:30 PM is available. Not here."
"August 27, 2018",50,Five Star Experience,"Excellent experience - a trendy/lively vibe and the food was top notch (best steaks on our trip). Our server and Matt the manager provided five star service. In a city full of steakhouses (we visited several others), this one is not to be missed."
"August 13, 2018",50,Best steak I have ever eaten,"The steak was amazing. People are horrified that I eat my steak well done, but here is still melted in your mouth."
"August 13, 2018",40,Very good overall!,"Great ambiance, service and food! A Betty good overall experience. The bone-in fillet was perfectly done and flavorful. Great drink options."
"July 30, 2018",50,Chicago Favorite,What can I say... it's one of the best in Chicago. Everything on the menu is awesome especially the seafood and steaks and sides and friend chicken and drinks... you get the point. Make a reservation they're usually booked up for weeks
"July 28, 2018",50,Best. Steak. Ever....so far.,"This has to be the best steak I've had. I had the bone in strip. I swear, the meat was so tender, you can cut it with a dull spoon. Service great, sides good. But I was there for the steak."
"July 20, 2018",50,Bavette’s - Chicago,I lived in Chicago for 8 years and best steak I have ever had! Highly recommend. Service was excellent. BYOB made it a great deal
"July 15, 2018",50,Best Steakhouse in Chicago,Lion's Tail cocktail was the best I've ever had. Ambiance and music was amazing. Delicious food all around. $50 cork fee waived if you share a glass of your bottle with another table.
"July 9, 2018",50,Delicious prime beef,"This place is one of the best steakhouses in Chicago. Delicious tender prime ribeye. The frites and aioli are scrumptious also. The place has charming decor, romantic but is super dark inside. I think they should light it a little more."
"June 25, 2018",50,Best restaurant in Chicago,"The best all around restaurant in Chicago. Ambiance, food, service, all amazing. Eat here and you will not be disappointed."
"June 18, 2018",50,Great Steak,"The food was amazing! The Shortrib Stroganoff is a must! As well as the Classic Ribeye-Chicago Cut! It is pricey, but worth it! It also has a great atmosphere! I would denfinitely go back!!"
"June 18, 2018",40,Great beef,"The steak was out of this world...juicy tender delicious,and .cooked to perfection. I don’t eat beef that much anymore but when I do....I want it to be great and it was Excellent and pleasantly efficient service Will do it again"
"April 1, 2018",50,Great food and ambiance,Beautiful place with great ambience and menu. The food was delicious. I had the petite filet mignon which was perfectly cooked. Nice music and friendly service. I had an awesome evening.
"March 29, 2018",50,Dinner at the Bar,"Quick bite to eat tonight, arrived about 6:30. No problem getting 2 seats at the bar. Dinner was delicious and service was fantastic. Shiz took care of us and we enjoyed the night!"
"March 25, 2018",50,Chicago Classic,"Bavette's is a Chicago staple. Each time a friend comes to visit, I will take them to Bavette's - it is undoubtedly a favorite."
"March 4, 2018",50,My favorite,"I feel transported to a secret 1920’s restaurant when I walk in. Amazing food, drinks and people! Definitely my favorite in Chicago. Ps. Save some room for desert!"
"March 4, 2018",40,Girls night out,Great food the hostess was very upity and acted very affected. She was to young to greet patrons with a snippy attitude. Not a great impression but the rest of the evening was delightful and the food was really good !!!
"March 3, 2018",50,Enjoying,Great beautiful experience. Will do it again Recommend to everyone. You won't regret it. Will do it again
"March 3, 2018",50,A different take on Steak,"Tired of the stodgy, old school, wood panelled room, typical Chicago steakhouse? Not that there is anything wrong with those. But if you’re in the mood for a different more French bistro, ideal for date night vibe while still being upscale - look no further."
"March 3, 2018",40,"Eat here,date night or couples. Delicious and unpretentious. High-end restaurant","Great,hip,swanky and original steak and seafood place. Make reservations well in advance. I’ve never had a bad meal."

"February 5, 2018",50,Just fabulous... no really!,The decor is just beyond.. and the food is utterly divine!. Bread is to die for -- and service is impeccable. !
"January 22, 2018",50,Best Bone Marrow,The restaurant is lightly dimmed which sets a great mood. Steaks are phenomenal. Best Bone Marrow in the city. Great selection of wine.
"January 22, 2018",50,Go here; not Gibsons,"Most people in Chicago head to Gibsons when they think ""red meat; big steaks"". For our money, we'd choose Bavette's any time. It's cozier, friendlier and we feel appreciated. And when you're spending this kind of money, that's nice!"
"January 22, 2018",50,The aged prime steak,"Once you have their special prime steak, you may never buy a steak at the market. It was large enough to share with one other. We love this place but it is a hard reservation so you need to plan ahead. Worth the planning!"
"January 21, 2018",50,Home Run,Great vibe .... bustling yet cozy! The food is excellent! It has a super friendly and accommodating staff! It is now a new favorite restaurant! Great date spot!

"January 4, 2018",50,A True Steakhouse,"Without a reservation, they were still able to squeeze us in. The service is outstanding. The best service we've ever had in a restaurant. Ever. The wine and steak were delicious. My husband still talks about this steak. Worth the trip."
"January 2, 2018",50,My favorite restaurant in chicago,OMG. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. SEAFOOD TOWER! Great cocktails! Very fine beef! We spent three hours gorging ourselves. Totally amazing everything! Service is stellar! Ambience is gorgeous! Can we move in please??
"December 28, 2017",40,Good but gouging,"Food was very fresh and high quality. Service was excellent, as was ambience. Only negative was price of 12 oysters $42 is just gouging guests. No price on menu for oysters so beware....perhaps I missed the pearl."
"December 28, 2017",50,Amazing!,"This restaurant is amazing! The service is wonderful, the food is delicious, and the ambiance is great! The Shrimp de Jonghe appetizer was awesome and you can't go wrong with any of their steaks! Definitely worth a visit!"
"December 22, 2017",40,Feeling Welcome,It can be overlooked because it is “not super trendy“. You can have a warm quiet dinner with great staff and even better GM Complementary house made lemon cello recipe was fun to compare with my blend and San Marcos from Positano Try It!
"December 21, 2017",50,Romantic and sophisticated,High-end steak and seafood. Excellent all around. My favorite dish is the king crab and Brussels sprouts on the side. Try the cocktails.

"December 21, 2017",40,Late lunch - perfect spot,"We had a late lunch with excellent service. The food took a little longer than expected but I believe it was during a shift change from lunch to dinner service. White tablecloth, very consistent food and service. It’s a great Chicago welcome home feel."
"December 21, 2017",50,FABULOUS Steak!,"I have no reluctance to say that the bone-in rib eye is the BEST steak in Chicago. Expensive but big enough to share, the salads, seafood, appetizers, and desserts are terrific. Sit downstairs—the main floor dining room gets quite noisy."
"November 30, 2017",40,N/A,"Service was friendly and knowledgeable. Food was good, but I expected better given the reviews and prices. If you're hungry be sure to order more than just an entree. If you go after 10 on a weekday you most likely won't need a reservation."
"November 30, 2017",50,Hidden gem!,Bavette's is probably my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Elegant and cozy with some amazing food and excellent cocktails.
"November 16, 2017",50,Always amazing,"This restaurant never disappoints, from the drinks to the service to the meal, always amazing! Their rib eye is by far the best I've ever eaten. Hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!"

"November 10, 2017",50,"Excellent food, busy place","Steaks were tremendous. Sides were very good. Service was excellent and knowledgeable. Got light dessert due to volume of food, so hard to review. Tables are very close to each other."
"November 9, 2017",40,Excellent service and food,"I love the steak frittes, surprising reasonable price and great steak with flavored salt, great fries and dipping sauce. I've also had the stroganoff and the chicken and both were excellent."
"November 8, 2017",50,Buzzing!,Totally full. People everywhere. Great atmosphere. Sat while waiting in mini lounge area just inside. Service suffering due to pace - many asks to get a second bar order. But steak excellent and accompanied by good value Zin from Dashe.
