"August 16, 2015",30,Expensive,Nice restaurant with old time feel. I ordered a blue cheese salad. It had LOts of small shrimp in it. The dressing was good. Also ordered a prawn cocktail. The horseradish was very hot but the prawns were gigantic.
"August 13, 2015",40,"A good steak and seafood place, with history.","Seafood, steaks and all traditional American courses. Seriously prepared and served. Additional bonus: it is an historical place linked to the Chandler's novel and Humphrey Bogart's movie ""The maltese falcon""."
"August 5, 2015",40,Good Old school grill house,"Have eaten here twice now and have enjoyed both times. Its an old style dining room(s) with a jazz backgound , usually someone playing upstairs. Good menu , good steaks , reasonabe wine list. Its mid budget and i would go again if in town."
"August 5, 2015",30,Great but less salt please,"Love the ambience, the old photos and the classic San Fran faire on the menu but the dinner items were way too salty. Steaks were good however, so perhaps that's the best item to order."

"July 2, 2015",50,Excellent fried oysters!,Service was great. The fried oysters are to die for. The best since I left Maryland 50 years ago. Don't get the combo platter if you are craving oysters. Get the biggest plate of just oyster that you can.
"June 30, 2015",50,Great seafood,My sister and I went for supper on a recommendation from our hotel staff. The restaurant opened in 1908 and it was like stepping back in time. The food was fantastic. We were so pleased that we had had this restaurant recommended to us.
"June 20, 2015",40,Great atmosphere and great food,"Stopped in here on our last day of vacation while in the Union Square area. Historic feel, lots of old town and celebrity photos taking up wallspace. Service was timely and kitchen was efficient. Solid four if not higher for the whole experience."
"June 13, 2015",40,Right out of the 60s,This is a great place for nostalgia. The clam chowder soup was amazing. Make sure you go to the second floor to see the Maltese falcon. It's worth the trip when you were in San Francisco.
"June 4, 2015",40,San Fran,Good food. Set a a booth near the bar for a little less noise. Not my fav but ok. Fried food was better than the fish. Little musty smelling but probably expected since it's so old.

"May 30, 2015",40,Delicious food,"Delicious food and served in big portions. Nice interior also. Only thing we didn't like was that when we were asked to check out the dessert card and we thanked the guy, like 2 minutes later he gave us the bill. Like saying: get out."
"May 26, 2015",50,Classic Steak Restaurant,Our steaks were well prepared. The atmosphere was nice. It has a real classic 1940s Noir feel to the place. Service was good and well coordinated. The medium rare orders came back pretty rare. Don't come here for tofu.
"May 24, 2015",10,Dinner,$30 for a steak and the waiter said I could use the butter on the table for my baked potatoe. Poor service and way over priced for the food.
"May 24, 2015",50,a good Chop House!,"Our food was very well prepared! The wait staff , very professional. We did find it a bit noisy, this is a very traditional chop house! Fun!"
"May 13, 2015",30,Average food... Lovely atmosphere,The place hosts live jazz artists and has a magical touch of character. Don't expect the food to amaze you though.
"April 30, 2015",20,There should be a lot of better options...,"We didn't choose that place, we were partying. The service was just average, the angus (really?) steak poor, and that was incredibly expensive for what we get. The only thing correct was… the ice cream. You'd better avoid it."
"April 26, 2015",40,Nice stay with the guys from germany,I stayed here again after i was there with a friend from San Francisco. The Steaks are delicious. We had all Steaks and everybody was fully satisfied. Nice Place to eat.

"April 16, 2015",50,Wow!!,"We had the Petrale Sole and Filet Mignon with real Bernaise sauce. We ate every bite. Really incredible. Old world decor, lots of dark wood, with white table cloths. The place was busy on a Sunday night."
"April 14, 2015",30,Decent Steak,Decent steak and efficient service. Many better options for a classier dining experience in the city but you can't go wrong here if you just want a good steak.
"April 6, 2015",30,Not a bad spot,There are better options in the area but it was convenient and good. Service was good and the music in the upstairs room is a nice touch.

"February 6, 2015",20,Go somewhere else,We went here because of the Urban Spoon reviews and were really disappointed. High prices and low quality food. My wife had a steak that could have been served at a Sizzler.
"February 5, 2015",50,Best Steaks in Town,It was the second visit in this restaurant. Very good service and great steaks - in my opinion the best in town. In second floor is a piano player available.
"February 3, 2015",30,Nice steak,"Nice meal, juicy steak and sides. A little high price, but good quality. Very central and easy to reach. The service was good too, Even if it is not the best steakhouse in San Francisco, I think I will come back."

"January 15, 2015",40,A step back in time with good food,"It's cramped, it's busy and it's a taste of old time SF. We tried the Petrale Sole which was very good. The wine list is good and the bread is really good. Worth a try."
"January 14, 2015",50,favorite,This is one of my most favorite restaurants. We took the cable car down to Ellis Street where this restaurant is located. It is a little hole in the wall kind of restaurant that is very well known and serves excellent food.
"January 10, 2015",20,Tourist trap,Ordered salad and mussels. The salad was OK but the some of the mussels smelled very weird and none was fresh. It's also way overpriced. The only aspects that brought up my experience were the service and the ambience/ music.
"January 4, 2015",50,Excellent place !,Very efficient and professional excellent food and. And incomparable atmosphere dating from 1895 but still cozy and very colloquial.
"January 1, 2015",40,Go back in time....,Go early so you can walk around and read the old press clippings and see the history on the walls. Good food but expensive. History is worth it though if you are a film buff.
"December 28, 2014",50,Great Steaks,"I called in to this restaurant while visiting San Francisco. I went for the porterhouse steak, great, cooked to perfection and good size portions. The place was busy, but I got seated quickly, over the week this was the best restaurant I visited."

"December 3, 2014",50,San Francisco Classic,I am vegetarian - and even though they have almost no main courses with vegetarian options - I would still come again. This is a San Francisco landmark and the service and experience are the highlight. Plus they make the best creamed spinach around!
"December 3, 2014",30,Traditional Steak House - Food not Special,"Three friends dined at John's and found it to be OK overall. The food was good, not great, the service was very good, and the prices were very high for what you got. For a San Francisco tradition, it was disappointing."
"December 3, 2014",50,Great Porterhouse steak.,"The Porterhouse steak is great. very nice with the Bernaise sauce. Try it with the ""Hullabaloo"" Zinfandel, they are a great match."
"November 24, 2014",40,"Terrific old-fashioned, american grill house",Great food (the NY steak was perfect) and wine. 2 minutes from union square this place can be a perfect solution for end of shopping day dinning.
"November 23, 2014",40,A step back in time with years of flavor!,It is a wonderful restaurant that has been there for decades - you can feel and taste that rich history. Steak and seafood were excellent. Tables are a bit close so it is not a romantic setting.
"November 15, 2014",50,A great evening meal.,"We tried John's Grill, what an experience. Takes you back in time and the food was great! Place is a little cramped, but that only adds to the experience."
"November 12, 2014",40,Great food and nice music,"Definitely need reservations. Ordered red snapper and lamb chops. Excellent seasoning and sides. Cooked to perfection.

"October 21, 2014",40,Good steak,"Service was prompt but not fantastic. Partner's medium filet was medium rare at best and more towards rare. My John's New York was rare as ordered. Wine list over priced and food prices on the high side, over all."
"October 19, 2014",30,"Big, busy expensive. Great service",This place has a ready made supply of custom given its position near Union Square. Only steak I eat in San Francisco. Good size but no fat or flavour. Perhaps I am a picky Brit but for the money somewhat disappointing.
"October 5, 2014",40,"Great restaurant, great food","They have good steaks and good sea foods, specially different kinds of fish. The price is high but I think there is a good value of money here. It would be congested for a bigger group."
"October 4, 2014",50,Great food!,Had lobster manicotti - was delicious. The atmosphere was nice - very busy! The restaurant is a favorite of my hostess.
"September 29, 2014",20,Gross,Started with can of clan chowder. Then dinner: Dry tasteless veggies. The grossest red snapper worth lemon sauce that smothers the fish. Dry baked potato. Not sure who reviewed this as highly as they did but I found it ghastly.
"September 28, 2014",40,Good steak house,"Good steak house, quick service, nice atmosphere. Not outstanding by any measure. Not a 'you have to eat here' type of place. But it has character and decent food. Also, had live jazz piano, which was nice."
"September 25, 2014",50,Always an excellent experience.,"We always find time to eat at John's Grill, and we're never disappointed. The food is always top notch, and the service is fantastic. The restaurant was very crowded, but we were seated and served quickly. I look forward to returning."

"September 6, 2014",20,If I ever needed knee work,I would come back to SF to John's Grill and order a John's Steak for the tendons for my knee. The Maltese Falcon and atmosphere were cool. Personally I would pass on this restaurant...
"September 4, 2014",40,Consensus was 'very good',"Recommended highly by our concierge, we were seated promptly, though it was a squeeze. The waitstaff was quite good, as was the food. We were 'on the fence' though, settled upward by rating it 'very good'. Clearly John's Grill has many positive attributes enjoyed."
"September 2, 2014",50,Best of the best.,"Excellent service, excellent food, excellent atmosphere. If we had discovered this restaurant at the beginning of our week-long stay rather than at the end, we would have returned to make sure that our first dining experience wasn't just a happy fluke."
"August 21, 2014",40,Busy and noisy,"...but the food was good, a little bit overprice, but worthwhile. American food well prepared, good wine list but expensive, so drink a little it only. Also, be aware the coffee on the menu does not have a price!"
"August 20, 2014",40,A little touristy but good,"This is absolutely a tourist spot but that doesn't mean it's not good. Order the steak and enjoy. Food cooked perfectly, service was sterling. Try the ""Bloody Bridge""."

"July 31, 2014",50,Nice place,We had dinner at John's one night. Nice old restaurant with the history. Price is in $30s. On a small street away from the Powell street madness.
"July 29, 2014",30,"Average steak, great location and history",Ask for table 21. John Konstin you have a great location and a bar rich with history why not get an excellent meat provider? Ordered the T bone and was not very happy. Suggest you look at Allen Brothers and go Prime.

"July 21, 2014",50,Hammett lives!!!,"The food is good, but the atmosphere is great. After a martini, I expected to see Dashiell Hammett come in. This was a place he frequented when he lived in SF. Sit in the back booth and wait for him."

"May 19, 2014",30,May 2014,"Great location, good food. Repeated requests to turn down the A/C(my wife does not like eating with her jacket on!) ignored. Hence reduced tip which was met with displeasure from waiter who a bit stroppy. Probably not go back."

"January 20, 2014",40,Great food in an authentic period atmosphere,"We, all ten of us, were walk-ins. We were greeted courteously and accommodated with no fuss. Service was prompt and efficient.

"July 31, 2013",50,"Great steak, Live music","Wonderful meal, amazing service. Good ambience and had live music playing. Prompt service and steak cooked just right. I like my drink a certain way and they gladly made modifications so it could be right. We had a nice little dinner here."
"July 15, 2013",20,"""Terrible""",There were was a fruit fly in both of our drinks. Rushed through. Both our baked potatoes looked like they had been sitting for hours. The only thing that saved the steak was the fact it was a good cut.
"July 13, 2013",50,Great historical grill with a lot of ambiance,"Went for a business dinner. Food was great, service was great, value was average. reservation needed, it's packed most nights."
"July 27, 2013",30,They like themselves better than I did!,"Super rushed and pretty obnoxious. Took the drink order, tossed a basket of bread on the table and immediately reappeared to get our food order. Literally had taken one bite of bread when the food appeared. Server then vanished until he popped back with the...More"
"July 25, 2013",50,Great dinner,"Ate at the restaurant last night with my sisters. Great atmosphere, good music and excellent food. The wait staff was very professional and attentive. The prawn cocktail was wonderful as was their homemade clam chowder. In a touristy area, it was an enjoyable San Francisco experience."
"July 25, 2013",50,Great food!,"We came there because we saw a recommendation on tripadvisor, from the outside we were kind of sceptical because it doesn't look very nice, but in the inside it is full of pictures and a jazz musician is playing during the dinner. The clam chowder is really good and the fish, really good portions and delicious."
"July 16, 2013",40,Nice dinner with friends,Busy little restaurant in Union Square area. We ordered the Escargots for an appetizer. Delicious creamy garlic butter sauce. I enjoyed the Filet Mignon while my husband enjoyed the NY Steak. Both were prepared to our liking. Pricing is what I would expect at most nice steak houses.
"July 15, 2013",20,"""Terrible""",There were was a fruit fly in both of our drinks. Rushed through. Both our baked potatoes looked like they had been sitting for hours. The only thing that saved the steak was the fact it was a good cut.
"July 13, 2013",50,Great historical grill with a lot of ambiance,"Went for a business dinner. Food was great, service was great, value was average. reservation needed, it's packed most nights."
"July 8, 2013",40,Pleasant dinner,"First off, if you're an old movie buff, this is your place. The actual Maltese Falcon on display, since this was Dashiell Hammett's favorite haunt, is a really cool ting to see, as is the award for the film, also on display. That aside, the food was delicious. Had an excellent cioppino, and others at the table all enjoyed their respective dishes immensely. Nice wine menu, as well. A little pricy, but not bad when considering the place, the atmosphere, and the quality of the food. Also had a guitarist playing light jazz, which added to the ambience. A good local place that's been aroudnfor a long time, and has a lot of charm."
"July 7, 2013",30,Disappointing,"Fillet steak was very nice but glad I asked for medium (which was neared medium rare). Johns Steak was nearer rare than medium and was gristley. Served with baked potatoes, which were very dry, and mange tout, which were near fperfect. Expensive for below average quality for one of the steaks."
"July 7, 2013",40,"Nice touch of ""old"" San Francisco","We had a family dinner for 11 people traveling to San Francisco for a much larger family reunion to follow. The reservation went smoothly, service was excellent, table location upstairs across the front window couldn't have been better, food was good but not great, and the live guitar player was excellent. Yes the food could have been better, but it really was pretty good. The ambience was interesting and exceptionally well done. Did I mention it was a bit expensive? But if I had it to do all over again for our 11 family members then I would do it because I don't think we could have found a more enjoyable place with such good food for our group."
"July 6, 2013",20,Overrated SteakHouse,"I guess since I'm from Kansas City I know a great steak when I see one and this was NOTit. Based on reviews my husband and I decided to dine here on our last night in San Francisco. We arrived around 5:45pm on. Saturday evening and were prompted seated.  Clam Crowder was great but lukewarm at best. Hubby had a T-Bone Steak which had a charbroiled taste that over powered the entire steak. Baked potato was very small and dry. I opted for the linguine dish and it was average. Finished the meal off with pecan pie which was average as well.  I understand that this place is a staple of the San Francisco Community but I've had much better steaks at Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Capital Grill or even Outback Steakhouse. Sorry but this is not a place where I will return. Best part of the visit was the live music"
"July 5, 2013",50,Super place,Very inviting and cosy.Wonderful service and tasty food.Very handy just off Powell Street.Fantastic and helpful staff too
"June 3, 2013",40,Excellent Steak House,Great atmosphere with live Jazz nightly. A couple of the best steaks we have had in our life - perfectly cooked.
"May 30, 2013",50,For all you Sam Spade fans,Take a little trip in time....go to the place that houses the Maltese Falcon and learn about more than that. Please order a classic drink and just look around.
"May 16, 2013",20,It was close by,"This place was close to our hotel, and we wanted to eat steak so we went here. Personally I didn't find the steak to be that amazing. Nothing about the place was very amazing. It was just OK."
"May 7, 2013",40,Great after show dinner!,"This classic grill still serves up great late night dinner in a nostagic setting. Steaks were excellent, service was good and wine list was strong"
"May 7, 2013",10,Don't Go to This Place on a Bet,Had a terrible experience here a year or so ago. Way too noisy. Awful service. Below average food. Felt like a tourist on an assembly line. UGH!!
"April 24, 2013",40,Steak Restaurant at it's finest,Loved our meal at John;s Steakhouse. Steaks were excellently cooked and served with a baked potatoe and asparugus. Prices weren't over the top for the meal or drinks.
"April 15, 2013",30,More hype than worth,My seafood crepe was mediocre. Our friends complained their steaks were only average and their potatoes cold. My husband liked his sea bass. Very crowded.
"March 31, 2013",50,A place with a history,"Excellent drinks, appetizers and food. Asked for the Halibut, which was a delight. We were in a party of 8, and the service - and price - were very good."
"March 27, 2013",40,A Little Touristy,Dined here for dinner while on a business trip. It was a little loud and filled with tourists. But the food was good and the service accommodating.
"March 15, 2013",50,Excellent meal great value,We had a wonderful lunchtime meal. Food service and atmosphere were all superb I am pretty fussy but this was excellent
"March 11, 2013",50,Great Food,John's Grill is located in the Union Square area. We were seated immediately even though we were early for our reservation. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and recommended great meals for all of us. The seabass was delicious!!!!
"February 16, 2013",40,Johns is old San Francisco,"Great Chops, Shrimp Cocktails À1.drawback tight seating old style. This can be fixed with a great cocktail' their pretty good!"
"January 21, 2013",50,Great Steak and service,"Book on line to reserve your spot, 3rd floor is very quite for larger groups, Rib eye steak is great and wine selection is excellent. walking distance from major hotels in downtown just up from trolley station. Funtimes"
"December 22, 2012",40,Fantastic Steaks,Our hotel concierge pulled a favour to get our family in at the last minute and we were not disappointed . The atmosphere was great and the steaks were some of the best we have ever had. We can highly recommend Johns.
"December 12, 2012",50,Cozy and Classy!,"We enjoyed a fine meal with great service after a busy day touring Napa! We were tired and hungry, and so glad to sit at a corner table while we enjoyed gracious service and delicious cioppino!"
"November 20, 2012",30,Place to go for nostalgia,"The place to go for the Maltese Falcon nostalgia, but food was average. Had a John's Steak (bone-in NY steak) and Anchor Steam Porter for Sunday lunch. The medium steak was a bit dry for my liking. Tried once but that's it."
"November 18, 2012",50,A place for steak,I went there with customer and as it is steak house so i choose steak .. And it is right decision ... The texture and quality of meat as well as timing of cooking ... It is right decision
"November 15, 2012",30,Humdrum,Had the prawns in Dijonaise sauce - and asked if pasta could be subbed for the baked potatoe (since pasta is on the menu) - not possible??? Rec'd the potatoe that tasted like it was baked in the morning.
"November 6, 2012",50,excellent food and service,This was a great place to eat. The service was excellent and the food even better. Our steaks were cooked to perfection. The portions were large. Food was flavourful. The cost was reasonable. The ambiance was super. I would recommend it.
"November 1, 2012",40,Dashiell Hammett Ate Here (or at least he should have),"Great atmosphere, attentive service, good food, nostalgic decor and the Maltese Falcon. Who could ask for more?"
"November 1, 2012",50,Great Liver,"If you like liver cooked to perfection, this is the place. Good to visit a Restaurant with so much history. I am a liver fan and they are really good. Great location in downtown, with good service."
"October 24, 2012",40,"Nice Steakhouse, Good Service",We ate here the night before our race. The service was excellent. Our food was delicious. My sister and I both ordered the halibut. It was cooked perfectly and the side accompaniments complimented the dish well.
"October 22, 2012",50,"The best by far,,, Book a table","The best steakhouse by a long shot, food is incredible not just the steaks but also the fish dishes. book in advance as this place gets packed out everyday."
"October 18, 2012",10,Crap,Food dreadful. Why do hotels recommend thus dump. Tables packed so close together you can't move. AC not efficient . Simply awful experience. Rubbish staff. Total tourist trap. Avoid
"October 5, 2012",50,Fabulous Steak and see the Maltese Falcon too!,We stopped in last night and loved the atmosphere and our dinner. My husband ordered 'John's Steak' which was cooked to medium rare perfection. The Vesper cocktail I had was dangerously delicious. - We will most definitely return.
"September 30, 2012",50,Did not disappoint!,"Loved the history and great location. This is the John's Grill of Dashiell Hammet's Maltese Falcon. Food at lunch was superb. Excellent service, well priced and nice portions. We felt like we had been somewhere!"
"September 25, 2012",50,Nice place to eat,Nice restaurant. Really comfort and the staff are great. The pasta with lobster is amazing! They have a nice options of steaks too.
"September 9, 2012",40,Good steak place,We were in town for a tradeshow and hit this place with some old friends. They handle crowds well and their steaks were good. Didn't try the seafood so couldn't comment. Solid place when your in town for business.
"September 2, 2012",50,This restaurant lives up to it's reputation,Excellent food at a fair price. Ambiance abounds. Great location for tourists. Old photos on the wall tell the history of the restaurant .
"August 30, 2012",40,"Good, but overpriced","I had the ribeye, my wife had the filet. The meat was very good, but we definitely left hungry. The overall experience was overpriced for what we got. I would probably not return, nor would I recommend this restaurant to a friend or tourist."
"August 10, 2012",40,Great and tasty,"A bit expensive for a lunch, but the food was super delicious and we ate as much as we could but still had leftovers. I had the club, bf had the seafood pasta. His was better and a bit more fancy than mine."
"August 9, 2012",50,Tasty,"It's very hard to give 5 stars to this place when you first see it. It's really crowded, smells, and is expensive (30-60$/person). What was good is the food. Everybody's meal was awesome. I'd return if I ever visit this area again."
"August 9, 2012",50,Ate there twice--enjoyed both meals,"We especially liked the cioppino and their fresh oysters. Of course, it's also a bustling scene. Decent wine list, good service."
"August 9, 2012",50,West coast road trip to San Francisco,Reservations are strongly recommended... Not overly crowded so as to disturb our dinner conversation but every table was filled. The food was first quality and the service suburb. A cozy and historical restaurant with good food.
"August 4, 2012",30,Overpriced; service 'icy',"Liked: Ambience; sense of historic relevance. Disliked: Icy service from waiters; food was totally overpiced, definitely not fair value for money."
"August 7, 2012",50,Enjoyable Evening with Delicious Food,"Although we had to take a taxi to this restaurant from the Marriott Marquis, it was well worth it. Known for it's steaks and seafood, this restaurant offered a variety of fillets in delicious sauces with interesting vegetables as well as pasta.The staff was professional,...More"
"August 5, 2012",50,A local recommended a visit to John's Grill,"A local we met in a nearby bar recommended John's for a good steak. That was good enough for us. This place has been around for over 100 years, so must be doing something right. It was Friday evening and the place was busy. Seating was tight, but that is all part of the experience. Steak was cooked to order, good local wine list and friendly staff."
"August 5, 2012",50,Delicious!,"Food and service were wonderful. When we arrived we were directed to a table close to the path leading to the kitchen. The host quickly noticed and offered a table up front near the windows and prepared it for us.  We ordered a couple of filets that were out of this world. Cooked to perfection. Get there before 7, preferably 6 or plan on airing. The restaurant is small and fills up quickly."
"August 4, 2012",30,Overpriced; service 'icy',"Liked: Ambience; sense of historic relevance. Disliked: Icy service from waiters; food was totally overpiced, definitely not fair value for money."
"August 3, 2012",50,One of my favorite restaurants to visit,"I will start off by saying that this isn't the perfect restaurant - but I'm giving it 5 stars because I just love it so much. It is a quaint place, with good food, good service, and a great story. If you want somewhere to spread out and have lots of space with a 2 hour dinner, this is not the place most nights. The steaks are done well, the fish that I've tried (Sea Bass and Sole) have been wonderfully done. Live jazz is played most nights, the wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly. I also like that I can have a nice dinner but not have it take 2 hours. The tables are close together and there are only a few tables with any sort of outside view - but there is much history (ie. connection to the Maltese Falcon) that will keep you interested in the surroundings. It's not for everybody, but I love this place and try to visit it every time I visit San Francisco."
"August 2, 2012",50,"Great service, yummy food","We visited John's Grill primarily for the proximity to our hotel and the old-style ambiance. We were there for our dad's birthday and what a great experience. Very good food, we had 3 filet mignon and one seafood cannoli which were all cooked perfectly. After they found out about Dad's birthday they brought out dessert with a birthday candle and 4 after dinner drinks- on the house! This meal definitely wasn't cheap but the service, food and atmosphere combination made it a great choice."
"August 2, 2012",40,Nice food but very dark!,We were recommended to visit Johns Grill by a friend who had recently been to San Fran. Being wheat and dairy intolerant I knew it would be hard for me to find places that I could eat at. Johns Grill is a no frills steak house - lit really darkly I'm presuming to create ambience! We were sat upstairs and were lucky as they has a musican on for the night. The meat / fish comes with the same sides - sauté vegetables and a jacket potato. My salmon was ok and my husband enjoyed his steak - he ordered peppercorn sauce at extra cost and the portion was small. Service was ok although it did feel like we were rushed out.
"August 2, 2012",20,Fast Food Steak House,Extremely poor service and food was marginal at best. Waitress was totally disinterested and we felt a rush for us to eat and leave so they could get the next customer in the door. Price of food is high for the quality of the food theft serve. Not a pleasant dining experience. They also spell out the tip you should leave based on percentages that start at 15%. Based on service and quality of food no tip is warranted at this resturant. I would suggest going elsewhere. Their dining experience is based on past reputation.
"August 1, 2012",30,to dark to read the menu,The table i was seated at was in the back by the bar .It was so dark i could not read the menu. After using a candle from the table i ordered the calms and pasta .When people stood up at the bar the behinds were in my face to small of an area for tables. The pasta must have been cooked the day before mush is all .I sent it back and was told by the hostess that it was fressh made overcooked is overcook fresh or frozen..Food was fair service was slow waited a long time for food. Chowder was good . Turn the lights on people at 2 in the afternoon the place is to dark sit in the front if you want to read the menu.
"July 31, 2012",20,"John's Grill, need some work on the service....","Hhmmmm ..... what can I say ... the food was not to bad and meals were received quickly, however they have some serious work to do on their overall service ... we waited 45 minutes for our plates to be cleared away after our main meal. Then at the end of the evening, we were literally bullied into leaving a substantial tip ... from a one off visit, the waiters give you the impression it's all about the tip with no real great effort on the service. If you want a nice, stress free evening I would avoid in all honesty"
"July 19, 2012",50,Loved the food,Older restaurant near Powell Street. Had the best chowder I ate on our trip. Nice nostalgic setting. Great history as related to Maltese Falcon.
"July 19, 2012",50,For food & Dashiell Hammett fans,"Excellent steaks and seafood in an atmosphere with a festive, old-SF feel. That may be because it's where Dashiell Hammett apparently set ""the Maltese Falcon,"" which statuette can be seen in a display case upstairs. Pricey but worth it."
"July 11, 2012",50,Fantastic :),"I ordered a chicken alfrredo which wasn't even on the menu. It was prepared quickly and professionally, as was my family's food. Great atmosphere and great live jazz guitarist! Loved it! :)"
"July 8, 2012",40,Great wine and chowder,"Loved the chowder- no bacon (so great for a pescatarian like myself) and I had a red Zinfandel, which I don't know if I've ever had before, and it was delish. Also really nice service."
"July 6, 2012",50,The Maltese Falcon and more,"Had a delicious rib eye steak dinner with cold beer in a cool atmosphere, home to the Dashiell Hammett Society and the Maltese Falcon of Humphrey Bogart movie fame -- and live music to boot."
"July 2, 2012",40,Great food with good atmosphere.,"This is a very busy restaurant so go early to avoid dissappointment. The food is excellent with medium to high prices, they also have live music which provides an excellent atmosphere."
"June 7, 2012",50,"John""s Grill","Old San Francisco. Always great food, service and a very pleasant locale."
"June 6, 2012",40,Great history compliments very good food,Traditional Italian-American food served in a setting celebrating San Francisco's real and cinematic setting for private detectives.
"May 30, 2012",50,Loved it!,Great little place with incredible food! Loved the dark paneled walls with all of the famous peoples picutes on it everywhere.
"May 28, 2012",40,Good steaks!,Fairly relaxed informal atmosphere. Good steaks - had a lovely New York strip. Desserts were good too.
"May 13, 2012",40,Food is not always important.....,"Come on.....to be honest with you.....I have never had a memorable meal here, but I keep going back, ...why.....it is a ""staple""....I can't visit San Fran without stopping in at John's Grill....Boggie was here!!!! Enough said......."
"April 7, 2012",40,The aura of the Maltese Falcon,"If you're into great food in a historical place - this is the place to go in SF... Steaks are great, and you'll spend time looking at the pictures and stuff on the walls instead of talking to your dining partners..."
"April 6, 2012",50,Historic Old Steakhouse,Great place for seafood and steak. Lots of options. Prices are around $$. Very close to Hotel Union Square.
"April 2, 2012",20,Eat somewhere else.,"Steak was horrible, dry and bland. As we're the veggies. Service was bad--waiter forgot our appetizer and tried to make it up with a dessert of HIS choice! Didnt even let us choose! Go to Mortins."
"April 1, 2012",40,Classic grill,"Good solid steak and seafood in a very traditional, dark, good ol' boys club atmosphere. Entire wall plastered with pictures of celebrities. Friendly bartender."
"March 31, 2012",40,Good steak,Steak was excellent - tender tasty and perfectly cooked We found the restaurant a little loud but that might have been the fault of the loud salesmen at the next table!! Service was fine Not much choice if u don't eat steak or seafood though
"March 29, 2012",50,Great Steaks,"All three of us had the exact same thing, Filet Mignon, and we all thought it was excellent. Nice atmosphere, great service - a really nice place for dinner."
"March 10, 2012",50,Herb Caen could have been in the room...,This place is fantastic. the servers were considerate and helpful. the other diners were very fun as well.
"February 29, 2012",50,Still the very best in San Francisco,"One of the best meals in SF. The place was busy, the service excellent and the food very well done. The price is a little high, but well worth for what you get. We go everytime we visit the Bay Area."
"February 27, 2012",30,Good for Bogart Fans,"This place is a nice place to get a drink, or eat a chop. It also appeared in ""The Maltese Falcon"" so it attracts Humphrey Bogart fans."
"February 16, 2012",40,Very atmospheric,Stumbled upon John's Grill on our last night in SF. Ate upstairs in the dining room. Live jazz music while we ate our delicious meal.
"February 14, 2012",50,Isn't that Bogart and Mary Astor at the next Table?,"Great steaks, in a cozy, paneled unhurried atmosphere. Not terribly expensive ."
"February 11, 2012",40,Great steak at a price,Great central location. Amazing steak but not cheap.
"February 3, 2012",30,JAZZY,"Fun old, classic place with a lot of history. Good food and a fun jazz singer a few nights a week."
"February 1, 2012",30,Tired and traditional......,"Everyone should visit the home of the Maltese Falcon, but don't expect anything out of the ordingary on the menu."
"January 30, 2012",50,"Very old, good taste and nice wine",Please keep your mind to eat John's Grill steaks and house wine.
"January 30, 2012",40,Maltese Falcon and great steaks,John's Grill was mentioned in The Maltese Falcon and lots of icons of the book are there. But this historic restaurant stands on its own. Great steaks and under $40 for the most part. Service is excellent.
"January 21, 2012",40,Fisherman's Pasta is outstanding!,We dined here with 11 friends during New Year's weekend. I enjoyed the Fisherman's Pasta dish which had lots of delicious seafood in a yummy basil cream sauce. My companion had the New York steak and was disappointed in its quality.
"January 16, 2012",40,Good food,We had a lovely meal here during our stay. Both of us had steak - both were cooked to our liking and tasted fabulous!! It was quite crowded when we went but it had a good atmosphere.
"January 6, 2012",40,San Francisco Prices,Great entrees and a glass of wine were very expensive. Make it a special event.Tables are crowded into small space - not romantic.
"December 23, 2011",30,unexciting but okay,A typicically busy diner in a cramped restaurant. Large hunks of meat without much by way of vegetables. But a pleasant enough experience for downtown San Francisco. Had to wait forty minutes for a table.
"December 9, 2011",50,If you want a steak go here,"Great service, excellent steak. I grew up on a farm in the midwest and am accustomed to good meat. For a great steak and baked potato go here."

"November 8, 2011",20,"If you like a lot fo noise, John's is for you","The service was fair, the food not all that great. I ordered the sole. Very noisy establishment and had to shout across the table to talk with my wife. I would not recommend this restaurant to any couple wanting a quiet dinner."

"October 25, 2011",30,Busy!,"Very busy and chaotic, nice food but endlessly being knocked by other diners got very annoying"

"September 13, 2011",10,Bait and switch,"Be careful. The prices on the menu are appreciably higher than on the restaurant's Website. Also, there is a $20 per person minimum."
"September 11, 2011",40,Nice nearby dinner.,"Neat restaurant near our hotel with a bit of history. It was hustle and bustle on a Monday night, but in a good, big city way. The food and service were both great!"

"July 18, 2011",50,A Memorable Evening . . .,"Arrived early for great drinks. My wife had the lamb chops and I had the New York cut steak. Both were superb, and cooked to perfection. The wait staff was helpful, but not overbearing. Not cheap, but a wonderful occasion!"
"July 13, 2011",30,Signature dish disappoints!,'The Lamplighter' is their speciality!! Sole stuffed with crab meat and shrimp..well iI got one piece of crab meat and 1/2 a cup of shrimp in each sole rolled up.. so disappointing......! great atmosphere though and I spoke to two others whose lunch was fabulous!
"June 14, 2011",50,Had a great meal,"This restaurant is a great piece of SF history. We found the meal to be wonderful, service good and ambiance interesting. Prices were in line with everything else in SF, high. But when on vacation $ doesn't really matter. A window table is great."
"June 14, 2011",30,Average dinner......close to hotels,"Our dinner experience was just average....overrated as a steakhouse. My wife ordered shrimp and it was not fresh. The service was ""ho-hum""....the waiter seemed to less than attentive.....I would not go back."

"February 26, 2010",50,Yumm...,"We had an excellent experience at John's Grill and still regularly drool over the chicken jerusalem and the great wine...we'll definitely go back when visiting San Francisco again!! The only negative thing was getting a table; but alas, we were lucky in the end!"
"January 23, 2010",50,Great classic resturant and steakhouse,"I went there two nights in a row because it was so good. I had steak one night and rack of lamb the next. Everything was great: the food, the service and the atmosphere. What more can you ask?"
"November 16, 2009",10,Never Go There!!!!,"The food was cold, restaurant smelled, service was horrible. This was the worst restaurant ever. We asked to speak to the manager and they had left already. DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!"
"September 12, 2009",40,A classic!,"Excellent martinis, and ambience! The roquefort salad was divine. Steak was good, but not exceptional. Service a bit slow , but the bartender was the best! We loved it."
"June 24, 2008",10,Not very good,Nice place with interesting history. My steak was tougher than leather and so was the wife's chicken breast. Not very good.

"February 24, 2006",50,Loved the Lamb and Martini's,"We had dinner at John's Grill last night and were thrilled with the ambiance, food and service. The best part of the dinner was being able to hear the live jazz in the background. The house specialty; lamb was so tender and juicy. When you...More"
"December 9, 2005",50,Where the smart people eat. Best of the Best! Bravo!,"If your looking for the best steaks, chops, and champagne there's only one place...JOHN's GRILL! I have eaten here no less than 40 times and every meal has been superb. The service is excellent and the ambiance is all Grace Kelly. With the old photo's on the wall and the white linen table cloth's your eating in herb caen's san francisco. This restaurant is where the locals go. Great prices and huge portions. The salads are fresh and the steaks melt in your mouth. I recommend the ""Sam Spade"" special with a bottle of champagne. Judge for yourself...Go to north beach and get ripped off with small portions and high prices or go to John's grill and pay less and get more. You won't be sorry. Avoid north beach, go to john's grill, have the sam spade special, and ambiance you will feel. EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! BEST OF THE BEST!"

"September 18, 2005",40,Very enjoyable,"Reserved a table the same day for Saturday at 8.30pm and the place was packed as we arrived. The tables are a little close together and lots of background noise, but this added to the atmosphere. Clam chowder to start, I had a porterhouse and my wife seafood canneloni, all excellent. Service was pretty good given how busy they were. Location excellent given we were staying at the Monaco, 10 minutes walk away."
"September 10, 2005",40,happy with our choice,"Very much enjoyed our dinner at John's Grill. We had vouchers for $100 for a choice of several restaurants and we chose this one. I loved the Chicken Jeruselum, but my husband said his ribeye was nothing special. We did enjoy it, but would not have wanted to pay the $92 bill ourselves."
"August 26, 2005",30,Decent but had better,"Johns Grill in San Francisco was very average, especially for the price. While it does have a lot of history to it. The dining area is quiant and charming. The food was average. Steaks were decent but nothing super. Prices were quite a bit, even by San Francisco standards. There are probably better steak places nearby that are better."
"August 14, 2005",20,Good food service a little questionable,"Made a Saturday 7:00 pm reservation with open table. We got their and checked in with the maitre d', it really did not seem like we were expected. We were told to go upstairs and have a waiter escort us to our table. This seemed unprofessional and the waitor upstairs seemed surprised we asked him to seat us. He ended up droping the menu's as he seated us and did not bother to pick them up himself. Very arrogant waiter staff almost seemed like they did not like to be bothered.  Food was pretty good. We had oystrers and a great seafood salad to start things off. My wife ordered lamb well done but it came medium rare. I had the John's steak which was very good.  I finished by martini and no one ever asked if I wanted anther one. Table upstairs are very close together, to close to your neighbor in my opinion.  With so many good choices to eat in the city I would not go back here for awhile. Maybe next time I will insist on eating downstairs."
"June 18, 2005",50,Best place to eat on Union Square,"Food was fantastic, Lobster ravioli and the calves liver were the best food I tasted all holiday. Service was great and the history and atmosphere of the place couldn't be beat anywhere. For a reasonably prices meal you won't get a better deal around Union Square."

The best part of the dinner was being able to hear the live jazz in the background. The house specialty; lamb was so tender and juicy. When you combine the history and all it was a bargain. We will take the drive across the Golden Gate bridge again soon to dine here."
