"November 6, 2019",50,Fabulous!!,"This was the tastiest Italian food I have had in ages! We had to wait 45 minutes for a table, but it was worth it!"
"November 3, 2019",40,"Pizza in Mulberry, downtown",Best pizza we have found on the edge of Little Italy and the price is right. We lucked on a cosy table and were well looked after all night. Good beers too. Be prepared to wait as it is popular for good reason.
"October 8, 2019",40,Recommended by a friend and lived up to it.,"Really enjoyed the friendly service and excellent food. Obviously popular with local folk, looking at the nearby tables."
"October 1, 2019",50,Razor Thin AMAZING Vodka Pizza,"I am sure there are many great places for pizza in New York, however the Vodka pizza at Rubirosa is the best pizza I have ever had. We asked to add pepperoni. We dined there twice. If my trip was longer would have gone again."
"September 24, 2019",50,Never disappoints,Every time we come to NYC we make a point to go to Rubirosa. The Caesar salad is great. Try the Tie Dye. You won’t regret it.
"September 6, 2019",50,Best calamari and pizza!,Can someone say thin crust? Can someone say melt in your mouth calamari fritti? Worth the wait at this little hot spot in Little Italy. Great menu with wonderful variety.

"August 29, 2019",50,Hidden gem in Little Italy - Avoid tourist traps and head here!!!,"I had this place on my list to visit in NYC. Place is small, and it was packed for a Sunday afternoon. We came here after a visit to the Brooklyn bridge and were hungry. They gave us a table near the bathroom. There is...More"
"August 26, 2019",40,"Great meatballs, Good Pizza",Walked in on a Saturday around 4 pm as a couple and were seated right away. We started with the meatballs as an appetizer and they were delicious! Then ordered a simple Caesar salad and large classic cheese pizza. Overall the food was very good but we had such high expectations of the pizza based on the other reviews and thought the crust was lacking flavor. We ended up just leaving the crust and not eating it as it was dry and hard. I would definitely go back but would like to try one of the other pizzas on the menu like the supreme.
"August 22, 2019",40,"Great pizza, very good starters, entrance service to improve","The place is small but cozy. It's noisy but if you have ever been in Italy you'll find it as part of the dinner. I do recommend to order any kind of pizza as it's really delicious. I don't recommend any pasta, but grilled octopus as entrance is really delicious. On the cons side I'd like to share that lady on the entrance is not guest friendly at all. She has informed us they not do booking at all and that we have to come in 45 min to get a table because they will have available one at that time. Finally when we came she has told us that there is no place, because we have to book the table in 30 days prior to our date of dinner (???!!!). I assume she has sold our table to someone else. It was really disappointed because we have invited our friends and recommended the food is really great there but finally we have to choose another place. 5 stars for food, 3 stars for service = 4 in average. Sorry for that."
"August 19, 2019",50,Worth Every Bite,"This was recommended to us by two different people and it did not disappoint! The restaurant was a little noisy but patrons near us were kind and we had the most delicious dinner. We cannot get this type of pizza where we live so can be critical and grateful. There are no complaints on the pizza or salad (including size - fed 3 of us!). They offered to split our pizza and prep in two halves which was perfect for us. Wine and appetizers were delicious, as well. We had the calamari and loved it! The marinara used for that dish was incredible! I am dreaming of having this again soon..."
"August 16, 2019",40,Great pizza in Nolita!,"Loved the pizza at this little restaurant. Got in without a reservation at 5 o'clock. There was a line outside afterward. Had the 1/2 Bianca, 1/2 Tie Dye--both were great with a thin crispy crust. . Sat in the back by the kitchen, which was actually a little roomier than the front section."
"August 7, 2019",50,Best so far,"We spent a fab weekend in the city for the John Mayer concert. I ate pizza and bagels all weekend but this place had in my opinion the best of all the places we tried, Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I am planning my next trip to NY just for the pizza. Please do yourself a favor and go there."
"August 6, 2019",50,New favourite.,"We visited Rubirosa in May after hearing good reviews. We booked 40 days in advance and were pleased we did.  Our waitress was welcoming and friendly and explained the menu and options too us.  We ordered ricotta ravioli with butter and a large vodka tie dye pizza.  Food was delicious, I will be recommending this place to everyone who visits NYC.  On our next trip we will have to visit more then once."
"August 4, 2019",50,So worth the wait!,"The classic think crust pizza is outstanding! Vodka sauce option is a good twist but can’t top the original. Simple and delicious. This takes pizza to a new level. Wait was over an hour on a late Saturday afternoon but put your name in, walk around the neighborhood, and wait for the text that the table is ready. Tight on space, but somehow the servers come and go with ease. Very attentive and friendly staff. No attitude. Full bar. Only one restroom I could see and there was a line."
"August 1, 2019",50,Must have!!!,"We had a party of 10 so we made reservations for the first seating and it was definitely necessary as there was a line formed prior to opening. Service was fast and helpful to make sure didn't order too much. We had the supreme pizza, the classic pizza and an assortment of pasta. Everything was amazing! EVERYTHING! This place is a must try!"

"August 23, 2018",30,"Great Pizza, but!",Great pizza but the wait is ridiculous. First we were told an hour and fifteen minutes. In total we waited close to two hours. No pizza is worth that. Plus the place is loud and cramped.

"April 2, 2018",50,Excellent thin crust pizza,"The pizza is amazing, very thin and crispy crust. Service is lovely. One pizza is enough for 2 to shares - at least 2 Europeans 😄. You can also order half and half pizza which is great. Thanks a lot to Rubirosa!"

"December 30, 2017",50,Excellent,Great pizza ( if you like thin crust) and a wonderful selection of pasta. Very fresh and authentic. Don’t be scared by the size of the pizza which can be shared and then share a plate of pasta.
"December 29, 2017",10,Never again,A traditional trattoria? Not really. Pizzas are good but this is an artificial trendy place and staff is not friendly (best case) or unpleasant (worst case). Nothing in common with a warm and old fashioned trattoria.

"October 18, 2017",30,Dissappointing pizzas and bad aircon,"The service and atmosphere were fine. We got our drinks and food quickly. However, the pizzas were rather boring and neutral. The air-con was very cold where we sat. We had to wear our coats and scarfs."

All were excellent and the portions were large. For dessert we got one order of zeppole which was excellent but was such a generous portion that there was enough for all of us. Only negative comments: The restaurant had lost our reservation, but fortunately was able to seat us a half hour later; and the table where we were seated was near the front door and every time someone entered we got a cold blast of air. The noise level is a bit high but we still could have a conversation."

"January 2, 2012",40,Decent meal in nolita without tourists,Ate here recently with family and enjoyed the meal. Has a neighborhood feel and without tourists which is not easy so close to little Italy.
"December 31, 2011",30,Not a place to remember,"We arrived to the place after reviewing a few remarks from people. We wanted a great pizza, but instead got to a place with an ok pizza. The pizza is different from the rest because it is really thin and toasted, has a lot of...More"
"December 28, 2011",50,Why go to NYC to hope to have wonderful meals? Because you will!,"Recommended by a friend who lives in NYC, Rubirosa is a great place to have a wonderful reasonably priced meal. Number one appeal factor, no tourists! That's one great sign. The atmosphere is what you would expect from being in Nolita, a small, authentic and welcoming place. I tried the roasted octopus which was wonderful. Some pieces were a bit chewy (the problem with cooked octopus), but most were little bites of heaven. With a bit of mache, tomatoes, roasted almonds... perfect combination. Then the classic pizza. Hard to describe. The crust is thin, cracking and buttery. The tomatoes are sweet and tangy (is that even possible?), the mozza is melting in your mouth. Also tried the cavatelli (my motto is, if there are homemade cavatelli, you have to have them--same with gnocchi; they have both, but don’t serve the gnocchi for lunch). They were perfectly cooked with a hint of garlic; the broccoli was a bit bitter, but just enough to marry the flavor of the bits of sausage. All of that accompanied by the house wine (white--2010 Borgo M. Friulano) with citrus nose and fresh taste. Perfect for this lunch. If I only had a bit more appetite to try more items on the menu... I guess I'll have to go back!"
"December 18, 2011",50,A Pizza That Gets Better With Each Bite,"My wife and I went to Rubirosa during our Christmas season trip into Manhattan. We saw great reviews on Yelp, Tripadvisor, and in New York Magazine and made a decision to eat a pizza for lunch. The restaurant is very easy to find, just being a block from the Spring Street #6 subway stop. We ordered an appetizer of fried calamari and a small fresca pizza. The circles and tentacles of the calamari were crisp, lightly breaded, and not greasy and were served with a small cup of delicious marinara sauce. The pizza was unlike any we’ve ever eaten. The crust was flavorful, very thin, and crisp. A slightly chunky tomato/pizza sauce covered the crust with wonderful globs of fresh mozzarella scattered about and topped with chopped bits fresh basil. There were small bowls of oregano, crushed red peppers, and parmesan for sprinkling. The amazing thing about the pizza was that it got better with each bite. Our only mistake was ordering the small instead of the large pizza. Our server was very good and placed a carafe of water on the table before taking our drink orders. The pizza was one of the finest tastes we enjoyed during a 5 day trip."
"October 26, 2011",50,Gem in Little Italy,Most Italian restaurants in Little Italy come up short on food quality. Not this one. We decided to try Rubirosa last Friday night. Our party of four could not get reservations but decided to drop by and see how long the wait was. Intitially we were told 30 - 45 min. Not bad. They took our cell number and said they'd call when our table was ready. Before we walked out the door they told us a table was available. The rest of the meal was as delightful. Homemade ravioli for two was over the top. Woke up the next morning thinking about it. Salads were fresh and flavorful. Wait staff was attentive and knowledgable. Will definitely go back next time we're in NYC.
"September 30, 2011",40,Undiscovered gem!,"Loved this place, it has a really natural feel and an artisinal flair. Good value in a relatively prime location, chilled out atmosphere and friendly service. Low key but high quality, the mixed greens were really fresh and had crunch and flavor, and the cavatelli with brocolli and sausage was a safe dish done really well. I'll be back!"
"August 29, 2011",50,Extensive Gluten-Free Menu options!,"I love Italian food and my husband is gluten-free - this usually means that I get my ""Italian-fix"" when I'm dining out with someone other than my husband! Well, Rubirosa has an extensive gluten-free menu. My husband had homemade gluten-free pasta that is to-die-for along with gluten-free meatballs - delicious! All of their pasta dishes are available in half-size portions too which is so great when you don't want to down an entire plate of pasta. Atmosphere and service was spot-on too."
"July 31, 2011",30,"Nice place, grumpy people!!!",If you are not from NYC don't go there unless you want to have a poor service but nice food.
"July 14, 2011",50,Best thin crust pizza around!,"Went here on the recommendation from Eric, the concierge at Trump SoHo. This small place is not much to look at but the pizza rocks! If you like thin crust pepperoni then this is your place. They sell by the slice and full pizzas.  We hit Lombardi's the next day and while it was excellent, we preferred the Rubirosa pizza."
"March 29, 2011",40,Authentic Italian,Great Authentic Italian food - especially the pizza. Smashing decor - looks like its been there a hundred years.
