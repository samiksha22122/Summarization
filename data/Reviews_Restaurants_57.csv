"January 9, 2016",50,Really Good,"This place has a wide selection of really good quality aged beef dishes. The service is very good and professional, too."
"April 15, 2015",40,"Excellent Steakhouse - But, A Little Pricey",Quality steaks and meats from all over the world. We ordered individually which was quite pricey.

Having that said, i realize this is probably one of the places i've been where they show more respect to beef and to countryside life :) all cow's where aligned by age, with fotos and with ""date of sacrifice"". It may sound creepy but it is not, not in my opinion. The staff was extremely helpfull with the wine and the deserts and everything :) now you know: get a cut from the 5th rib!"
"April 15, 2015",50,Good and tasty,Vaca Nostra is a very good steak house with fresh meat and perfect wine. The waiters are speaking English and are all very supportive in giving you a good experience in the restaurant.. If you want a steak and you are okay with the location being 20 Euro in a taxi away from center - this is the place..
"April 15, 2015",40,"Excellent Steakhouse - But, A Little Pricey",Quality steaks and meats from all over the world. We ordered individually which was quite pricey.

"January 10, 2015",40,Great if you have a craving for a tender steak,You can choose which part you want from the raw meat hanging in the restaurant and how you want it cooked.

"February 17, 2014",40,Very good food and wine,Great T Bone. More medium rare than medium but still very good and Rioja by the glass was great Not cheap but ok on a business budget
"January 27, 2014",10,Simply Terrible,"We went to this restaurant with high expectations and left with the absolute opposite. And as we were visiting Madrid Fusion gastronomic fair we all have a high level of knowledge regarding food, we choose this restaurant because they had a Jopser charcoal grill installed and an in-house butcher with dry-aged meat. This was starkly contrasted as soon as we put the first fork in our mouths, with dry, yesterdays chicken and it only got worse. They simply have no excuse as we tried each different type of meat on the menu. The wine was good, even with the inflated price and pouring it ourselves. The complete restaurant team were absolutley incompetent apart from one which despite showing signs of caring about our honest opinions on leaving did nothing to even remotely convince us to return. Such a shame, such a waste of a fantastic concept. The owner should be ashamed to let this place go the way its gone with so much opportunity."
"December 30, 2013",30,The meat is good quality (not the best in town)...but the management.,"We went there as the typical Christmas office meal, in any case, we were very well informed on the quality of the meat and what to expect on flavor & grilling of it, same deal as to the quantities we would need.  The waitress was also very helpful just until the point when we asked as entree a burrata dish (which was very discreet I may add), we asked for 2 servings (we were 9 people) but since the servings come in 4 VERY small pieces of burrata (this is where they got cheap, normally a well-served burrata would have been enough for the whole 9), so we were short 1 piece and we asked if one could be added, the response was no, no way repeatedly. If you are going to serve a +700€uro meal, you don´t do this stupidity to piss people off, most likely I won´t go back there just because of this, this type of adolescent behavior is not well looked upon in Spain...in any case, it wasn´t the waitress´s call it was the maître who did the call....bad call dude, bad call, this is Madrid and not NYC, this is a common request here, and we were business people on a Christmas meal, not some hipsters trying to get into “da coolest place”, so wake up to reality.  Coming back to the meat, it was cow, 3 different types, grilled ""à point"", good strong flavor for meat lovers, wines & beers good as expected. As usual I passed on the desserts and went straight for my Gin & tonic and was mixed decently.  I won´t come back soon, for that price there are better meat places in Madrid that I´m sure will be more than glad to accommodate a mayor request like an extra piece of burrata ;-)"
"September 14, 2019",10,No good at all,"If you want to go back to the stoneage, come to this place. The food was very boring and the staff as well. If you want to experience good food do not come here."
"March 10, 2019",50,very nice atmosphere and tasty food,This is a nice restaurant with a friendly atmosphere and great history. The food was tasty and the staff welcomed. I will come back there !
"February 13, 2019",20,Cahrged enviroment,Poor qualitity in relation with the price. The local needs a reform. There are poor alternatives for vegetarian people.
"October 26, 2018",40,"Good, but I was expecting more","Asador de donostiarra is one of those places well recommended. I enjoy my meal. nonetheless, for the price you pay the quality does not reflect it Hope your experience is different than mine"
"October 25, 2018",50,Possibly one of the best restaurants in Madrid?,First impression: on the wall are photos of footballers and other famous people which subliminally makes you feel that you have just entered hallowed ground. The restuarant exceeds one's expectations. The food was superb. Every dish! The service is excellent! What a great place.

"October 23, 2017",50,Unbelievable food and service,A must in Madrid. Great food but even better was the service which was second to none. I’ll come back here any time in town. Beef is definitely center stage. Many extra food and drinks without asking. Made you feel like a royalty.

"September 23, 2017",50,Fantastic meal,"Had dinner here with our teenage daughters. Waiter (Orla) did not speak much English but was very helpful, polite and attentive. English menu provided (good as our Spanish isn't particularly good). Ordered corn dogs as the girls wanted to try them - very sweet so left most of it and the owner insisted on removing them from the bill - even though we tried to explain they were nice but just too sweet for us. Was really impressed when told he does not believe that people should pay for something they did not enjoy. Husbands pulled pork burger was the best he's ever eaten he said. Daughters macaroni sandwich was devoured (and she's a really picky eater). Our burgers were delicious and cooked well done - some other places the meat was still pink even though we asked for it not to be cooked that way. Wonderful place. Busy with locals picking up orders so obviously got a good reputation. Would definitely go back."

(The fish was the last one on the fish section--I can't remember the name). My fish was moist and very tasty. There was an orange colored sauce under which was very smooth, not fruity. They also brought us some potato chips, but not your ordinary chips, these looked like mini pillows, fried. They were very addictive!!  For desert, we ordered the doulche (something like that), which was vanilla ice cream on top of a cookie covered in chocolate. On the plate was a vanilla pudding with strips of chocolate over top. One of the best deserts I've ever had. They also brought us on the house warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream and these sherbet shooters. The shooters were the best probably.
