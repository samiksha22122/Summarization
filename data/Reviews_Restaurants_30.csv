"July 31, 2012",50,Delightful,Best ingredients used at this wonderful little Italian restaurant tucked away from the crowds of Sacred Coeur. Great value - one of our top meals in Paris bar none.
"July 14, 2012",40,Friendly local eatery.,Came here cos of the great reviews and were rewarded with fab service and delicious pizza/ravioli and salad. Great deserts too. Just a stone's throw from sacre coer but far enough away from the mad tourist crowds and inflated prices.

"April 4, 2012",50,"Fantastic food, nice atmosphere and pleasant service","My husband and I went to this little very nice restaurant on our holiday in Paris. We loved the place. Very humbly and authentic interior and spotless clean. The food was outstanding - and especially the lemon ice creme for dessert was very tasty. The restaurant is located right beside the Scare Coeur on your right hand side when you are facing the church. The prices are small and the taste, service and atmosphere big. I would go there any time again."
"March 12, 2012",50,Best meal in Paris,We stopped here after sightseeing all day and came across this tiny cafe next to sacre coeur. We had the caprese salad and a pizza and both were amazing. Very good value and not at all touristy or a trap. Best meal experience yet in Paris and probably of whole European vacation so far. Highly recommended!
"March 10, 2012",50,Great Experience,"I was on a study abroad trip. Myself and four other students were starving and decided to stop in this cozy cafe. The food was delicious and the dessert (like a chocolate lava cake) was phenomenal!!!!! And for 11 euros for lunch it was a great deal.  The waiter was great, friendly, warm, and inviting. He spoke English very well and was a sport when we wanted to take pictures. I would definitely recommend a stop in here. It is in the Montmartre area, very close to Sacre Coeur.  TRES BON!!"
"February 29, 2012",50,"Fantastic find, best pizza ever!","We stumbled across this small quaint funky restaurant whilst visiting Sacre Ceour and was delighted to find that even though it was right next to the Church, (round to the right if you're facing towards the church), you could imagine that you were in a small village away from all the hustle and bustle that was minutes away! It wasn't at all touristy or like all the other restaurants that was horribly touristy! Pizza was amazing, probably the best pizza we've ever had! (We are massive pizza fans)! We will definitely be back!"
"November 27, 2011",50,Local Treat,"This was the best pizza I've had in my life. Very small place (not a tourist trap) with great ambiance. Simple, but fresh ingredients and the olive oil they give you to go along with your meals is to die for. Will definitely come back if ever in Paris again."
"October 16, 2011",50,"Excellent food, nice atmosphere, warm service",We were tired and hungry after a long morning of sightseeing in Paris. It was near the Sacre Coeur where we started to look for a place to eat. We wanted to avoid any tourist traps and find something nice. We were lucky because only 200 m walking on Rue Lamarck we have noticed this tiny bistro. Tiny might be the only negative aspect in case you are not used to the Parisian bistros. I think we were served by the land lady or by someone directly involved in the business. She beautifully completed the warm atmosphere of the place and made us feel good and take care of. This kind of treatment is not something you find easily in Paris especially close to a landmark such as Sacre Coeur. They serve Italian food and we found it delicious. I strongly recommend it when you're in Monmartre area.
