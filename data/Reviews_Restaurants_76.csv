We both find it very interesting to cook on a hot stone and with the guidence of the staff you get your steak perfectly cooked to your liking, we decided to order a bottle of Pinot Noir Rose and it complemented the food perfectly.

Great service melt in the mouth steak makes it an easy choice very rare steak taste this good in the UK.
"February 24, 2015",30,Hopefully not the best....,"We dined here on a Sunday night in Feb 2015, and as big steak eaters were looking forward to it. We were lead into a back room and sat next to the wine fridges, the front of the restaurant never got busy and the back room had only 3 tables occupied to lacked any atmosphere. The staters were fine, nothing to complain or rave about. The steak was lovely, cooked just as we asked but the whole experience was fine, nothing more and didn't equate to the price. Eaten steaks all over the world and would be disappointed if this was the best Budapest had to offer. Probably wouldn't bother going back."
"February 24, 2015",50,Awesome steaks,"Pampas is an excellent restaurant. Steaks are top tier, as well as the side dishes, starters and desserts. We really enjoyed our T-Bone which was done professionaly and was one of the best steaks I ever ate. The duck in cumberland souce was also remarkable,and the creme brule was also very good. Service is also great,and the price is great for a place at this level."
"February 24, 2015",50,What A piece of Meat,"Going to this steak house was the worst thing I have ever done as I will never find a steak as nice again. I got the NY steak medium rare with garlic butter,it was cooked to perfection and really tasty.My partner got the chicken with bacon cheese and roasted veg I can't remember the name of it that was also lovely. It has a high class atmosphere,jackets taken at the door kind of thing, but a extremely reasonable price list,total came to €60 which included steak,chicken with 2 sides,desert 3 beers and 2 glasses of wine. If I was to fault it it would be because o received no potato and veg but I don't know if potato And veg are Ment to be included with the meal or was it a language barrier when I was ordering my side but u did not receive any and the couple next to us did and the waiter did mention it. Hit u would highly recommend this place"
"February 23, 2015",30,Decidedly average.,"After having 4 days of outstanding food in Budapest we wondered how they would fair with Steaks, but unfortunately it was all a bit disappointing. I must say that the staff were friendly and helpful, but unfortunately the food was not special. I started with garlic prawns- which were literally deforested and flung in a bowl of garlic- lazy and boring. The steaks were better though my boyfriend was over cooked.  All in all I probably wouldn't return."
"February 20, 2015",50,"Phenomenal Food, Drinks, Atmosphere and Price!!!","Whilst visiting Budapest over valentines weekend, my boyfriend had booked us in for a meal on valentines evening. With us both being avid lovers of a good steak we were very keen to try out Pampas steakhouse as we had seen great reviews about it online, and let me tell you one thing, it did not disappoint!  We had our table booked for 9pm, and although the restaurant was very busy, we were taken to a lovely table in a quietish corner of the restaurant. We decided to skip starters and we both opted for big steaks and a nice selection of sides. The meat was among some of the best steak we have ever eaten, the sauces were divine, and the sides, although not to our personal taste were beautifully presented and I'm sure would have been delightful for the right person.  The staff were friendly, efficient and helpful (especially when we inquired about the best spot to move on to for drinks after!) and the atmosphere was perfect for a romantic date night meal, but also perfectly suited for groups of friends chatting and catching up over a bottle of wine and divine steak!!  Overall we paid the equivalent of what would have been about 70 euros for 2 tenderloin steaks, 2 sauces, 3 sides, 4 pints, 3 glasses of wine and a desert!! would 100% recommend to anyone looking not only for a quality meal out, but something that's not going to break the bank either!"
"February 17, 2015",50,Stunning!,Excellent food and fantastic atmosphere. The waiters had good recommendations and spoke truthfully about their favorite dishes on the menu. I recommend the shark.

"February 3, 2015",40,Speaks for itself,"Large variety of steaks, in different sizes. Took the goose liver brulée and the N.Y. strip with a malbec, both prepared very well. Service was fine, but could have been slightly more attentive."

"April 1, 2015",50,Best Steak House in Budapest,"Definetly the best steak house in Budapest, the atmosphere is amazing and great, the cocktails, the food and the service is all impeccable.  The Fois gras is one of the best things you will ever have in Budapest, but the starter portion is enormous, actually everything is quite enormous, expect for the steaks which are well sized (different sizes can be chosen).  A lot of choice to accomodate anyone, not just the steak lovers.  Of course it is on the expensive side, but definitely worth it."

"March 18, 2015",50,"It's Discount Week, but everything was Top Grade","This is Restaurant Week in Hungary. Many restaurants across the country have a fixed menu for a reduced price. We decided that it was time to try Prime Steak and Wine. The price may have been reduced, but the food was marvelous. I had beef soup with potato dumplings, roast duck breast (moist and tasty-not all dried out) with red cabbage and potato pancakes, and a chocolate brownie with raspberry sauce, My wife had chicken salad, penne pasta with beef strips and rumbaba for dessert. Everything was as full of flavor and intensely good as it could be. Everything! I had to call the police at the end of the meal, because nothing can taste as good as that rumbaba, and still be legal. It was garnished with apple, pomegranate and topped with lemon sorbet. I'm still dreaming about it, hours later. We are from Washington and Oregon, where some of the best wines in the world are made, and live in a wine producing country (Hungary), but I had a hankering for Malbec, and the 2009 Palo Alto from Argentina was one of the best I've had. The service was impeccable. That's all I can say."
"March 18, 2015",30,"Fantastic food, appalling service","Shown to our table, food and drinks order taken promptly. Main course arrived, fantastic food cooked to perfection. However the wheels came off after the table was cleared. Both our drinks were empty and no staff asked to replenish them. After a 25 minute wait we askef for the boll. No offer of sweet or cofy menu had been nade in this time. A further 20 minutes weny by until the boll appeared after reminding staff. Maitre dais not onterested on feedback. Fantastic meal spoilt by appalling service."
"March 17, 2015",50,Perfect steak,Visited with a colleague on a random Tuesday evening. Have eaten in some of the best steak houses and although this isn't up there with the best in the world it's certainly first class and the best steak I have had in Hungary. Exceptional food really is what is important but this is a good atmosphere and what a steak house should be. I will be back!
"March 16, 2015",40,Yum!,"We went here on our last night in Budapest and I'm so glad we did, the food was fab and the atmosphere was great. The only downside is it took 50 minutes for our mains to arrive and we didn't even have a starter other than that we had a lovely time. I had the Veal, which was delicious and my partner had the New York Strip, which was also very good.  I would definitely recommend going but do book because we could only get a table for 9pm."
"March 11, 2015",50,Fine steaks in Budapest,"This is the fourth steak house, what I've tried, so I'm relatively beginner of steaks (but I like it rare or medium rare so there's hope :) ) The meats are the best, all what we tried are exceptional soft, tasty. We tried the Quality Filet Mignon tasting menu (USDA Prime Black Angus, Omaha, Australian Angus, French Charolais) Its enough for two not so hungry person. It's almost full on a weekday evening with english speaking guests, so it must be good in an international level. A bit noisy, so better for chatting with friends than business or romantic dining. The service is professional, you can trust them. The price is above than average of course, but a similar style nearby steakhouse is a bit more expensive, and Prime's steaks are better."
"March 4, 2015",50,Primed & Ready....,"I've now eaten 3 or 4 times at this smart dining venue in Budapest, and remain impressed with the quality & presentation of the food.  Obviously, it's a steak specialist, and offers an enormous choice of enticing-sounding cuts from around the globe. However, as many of them also have mouth-watering prices attached to them, I tend to opt for one of the smaller filet mignons...they're consistently very good. Starters I've enjoyed include the home-made soups, and the main course side-dishes are all excellent  The ambiance and decor are very good, with the illuminated wine racks & stained glass ceiling area amongst the eye-catching features.  Prime is certainly a more expensive dinner option than many alternative venues in Budapest, but it delivers a level of service & quality consistent with its goals. If you're looking for somewhere a little easier on the wallet, I have reviewed several very good alternatives here on Trip Advisor"
"February 17, 2015",30,"Good food, disastrous waiting","This is a modern, airy restaurant which was packed when we visited. Staff were courteous when showing us to our table. We looked at the extensive menu and, in keeping with the name, ordered steaks. Whilst waiting for our starters we received an amuse bouche which was very tasty and accompanied by chocolate bread which was very different. Not long after we received our starters. I had the king prawns with garlic and chilli sauce. They were superb. My wife had the caesar salad with prawns and found it delicious. This was all with 30 minutes of sitting down. Then the problems started. I noticed that in neighbouring tables people were getting agitated waiting for their main courses. At first this did not bother me as I was enjoying the atmosphere, with a discreet duo playing music in the background and general bustle of a busy restaurant. Unfortunately we had to wait 80 minutes for the main course! Unfortunately we were never told the reason for the inordinate delay. The couple next to us, when they finally received their steaks sent them abck as they were not cooked as requested. Two other tables got really exercised about the delay. When my steak arrived it was an Omaha striploin and it was very tasty and cooked as requested. My wife had an Argentine angus cooked as requested but hers was a bit tough. I had mash and caramalised onions and it was lovely. I certainly would have given an adiitional star for the food but that delay was totally unacceptable and when I enquired from the waiter he just put it down to a problem in the kitchen. Such a pity and this place was not cheap.Totally unacceptable."

"November 8, 2011",50,I want to marry this place!,"Happened upon Prime whilst in Mammut. All I can say is OHMYGOD!!! It was beautiful. The waiters were polite and mannerly, the lighting was perfect and so was the music. All very chilled. I am a total foody and found EVERYTHING i ate and drank was just perfect and bliss. The smells and taste of the food combined with the atmosphere around me filled my senses and made for a perfect dinner which my partner agreed. I also would recommend that you try the chocolate, cinnamon and lavender drink.....dribble.... perfect book end to the dinner. When I paid, the waiter even came to us and said that the tip we left was too much! But to be honest, for the experience we had, everything we paid was more then worth it. I would highly recommend Prime for a meal if you are in Budapest and I hope you love it as much as we did."
"August 22, 2011",40,A little piece of home...delicious!,"I seriously think I'm in love with this place. I have been here at 5 times and have enjoyed each visit! My husband and I have been living in Budapest for 3 years now and never really had a good steak until we went to Prime! It is delicious, tender and flavorful. I always order the petit filet mignon and we share the truffled mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, caramelized onions and fries... Sounds like a lot but easy to finish! My 2 year old son loves the food as well. He always has the Panko crusted chicken with honey mustard. The desserts are ok, nothing I can rave about. The strawberry lemonade is delicious as well. Great food, great service and the atmosphere is nice...once you forget you are in a shopping mall."
"June 17, 2011",30,"Good Service, Average Food","I stumbled across this place in the Mammut I and it looked really distinct so decided to go in. The greeting was very professional and was shown to a table by the window. Everything is nice and decorated nicely. The waiters were very professional and seemed to know what they are doing. The prices are a bit too expensive for Budapest standards and the food was just about average. I was a little disappointed to be honest that I had to pay a premium price and get an average meal. All in all, good service, nice decor, average food."
