"April 7, 2019",50,Good Restaurant in Rome,"A nice quiet place to eat after hearing an evening concert at the nearby Teatro dell Opera. The service was good; the food, tasty; and the prices quite reasonable. The owner and staff were very gracious - they made our visit very special!"

"November 20, 2018",10,No!,"disgustingly not tasty !!!! inside the restaurant we were waited by a waiter in a jacket, the food was over-cooked, brought by the missing stinky oysters"
"September 7, 2018",50,Delicious and homemade.,This place we just happened to walk past. We enjoyed a fabulous meal with risotto and real homemade pasta that tasted delicious. The staff seemed to know their wines and we were recommended one that was absolutely to our liking.
"August 21, 2018",10,Cheaters,They served me fish but they didn't tell me that fish was 600g. Really ... They cheated me. I really don't recommend this place. The waiter should ask me if I want to order such a fish. An usual portion has 300-350 grams..
"July 24, 2018",50,Il Botticelli,"Amazing food, good location, so far the best hospitality as the waiters are humble and attentive. I however recommend that you still stick to the food in the menu to enjoy better"

"May 5, 2018",30,Nothing but average,"Not much to be said about this restaurant. Good position with a small terrace in front. Service is average, food the same. Not to pricy. Inside environment is nice and pleasant. All together it can be a safe choice if you are not demanding."
"May 2, 2018",40,Nice food. Wine a bit pricey and service is automatically included,"The food was ok, tasty, served quickly - but the restaurant was quite empty. Service had automatically been added to the bill, which I don‚Äôt like. But otherwise, not a bad meal and not a bad price."
"April 20, 2018",10,Terrible - don‚Äôt get sucked in by the host,We made the mistake of being sucked in by the host. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake. Bad food and flat beer. Our waitress actually made fun of us to the table next to us for not getting dessert. Huge tourist trap.
"April 8, 2018",50,"Awesome food, awesome people",Met mauro on the street and came back for dinner later with some friends. Super friendly and the hospitality was just insane the food tasted great and we got a group photo after. Great addition to the Rome trip

"February 6, 2018",40,Nice Restaurant just off Via Nazionale,Had a nice meal here during our stay in Rome. The owner Mauro made us feel v welcome and was very chatty (speaks perfect English as he lived in Canada for some time). Highlight was the Sea Bream which was excellent. Would recommend.
"February 2, 2018",10,Organised Chaos,Worth a visit but don‚Äôt eat. This place is absolute bedlam. Good for a drink and a laugh at Manuel‚Äôs expense.

"August 22, 2017",20,Terrible service,We ordered sparkling water for my husband and still water for me and our daughter. The sparkling was delivered and the still water was never delivered. Pasta was tasty but small portions. No offers of drinks or desserts...terrible service.
"July 14, 2017",50,Il Botticelli,Amazing food with wonderful service. Erta was wonderful! The prices were reasonable and the speed was acceptable! Great location from the Main Street!
"June 28, 2017",20,Mediocre,"Service was average, food was poor. I like al Dante pasta, this was very undercooked. I had to wait for the bill after asking for it 3 times."
"June 4, 2017",40,Outside seating. Good service and food.,We went there after a long day of touring. The food was good and the service very attentive. It was great to sit outside and enjoy a drink and a pizza/pasta.
"April 6, 2017",30,Average,"A little too ""Euro"" shek for me but the staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered a bottle of wine a few small plates of cheese etc. Out door seating is a little awkward since it's almost in an alley."
"March 29, 2017",40,üëçüèΩ,Staff members were very kind and knowledgeable about the menu. Order a Botticelli Cheeseburger that could feed two people and a glass of wine. Nice lunch spot for anyone staying around the Republique. Cheers!

"October 13, 2016",20,The Greeks,I can not have a comprehensive proposal for this restaurant. All I can say is that we got two pizzas and were very poor. The interior is quite nice.
"October 9, 2016",10,Pathetic,Any resemblance to Italian cooking was purely coincidental. Caesar Saldana made with mayo. No anchovies. Mozzarella rubbery. Tuna I ordered was unrecognizable as any kind of fish. This was the worst dining experience I have ever had in italy.
"September 28, 2016",50,Tasty food and great atmosphere,Service was good and friendly. There was enough assortments of meals. I'll take pasta and my husband take cesar salad. Portion were big and sufficient. Taste was wery good. Best pasta I have ever eaten.
"September 20, 2016",10,Terrible and waste of money,"Poorly tasting food, service ok but overpriced tasteless food. Avoid if possible. Meal was huge but the burger I had was worse than anything I have had at a fast food place. My husband had spaghetti and meatballs that was tasteless"

"July 25, 2016",40,Nice find,"Enjoyed a decent dinner. Mozzarella and tomato to start was really good. Meatball spaghetti was yummy; shame they couldn't do a mixed salad even though they had all the ingredients! Anna, as outside waitress, was fab. Il conto was average for the area."
"July 22, 2016",40,Great staff,"Friendly energetic staff. Good service. The food was good but not great. They seem to have an aversion to air conditioning. Sweating during a meal is not top of my list. Live entertainment was good,"
"June 19, 2016",40,Friendly and Efficient,"We were just passing and this place was down a side street, so we thought we would give it a go. We had lunch here and all ordered something different, food was good and service very efficient. We sat outside."
