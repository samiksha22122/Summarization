"May 1, 2015",50,A pizza you will never forget.,"It's unbelievable but in this small restaurant, totally off the center you can have one of the best pizza experience in your life. The restaurant is family run by a typical Roman family. Very friendly and with great service although the restaurant has only one bench and two tables. Do not go there thinking that you can sit comfortably because this won't happen. The pizza is mostly for delivery or eat it quickly there. However, it's worth it since the dough is fantastic, very fresh and every ingredient pure. They are also great people with a smile. Well worth it if you are not looking for fancy places."
