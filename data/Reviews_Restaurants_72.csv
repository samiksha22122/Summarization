"December 15, 2013",50,A step back in time for Cafe Culture,"My experience was at lunchtime, lazy afternoon and it was an enjoyable find. The food was good family Itallian cooking, and the portions were large. My bruchette starter was probably enough, but I still had the main course to go. Reasonably priced and just a great place to people watch and soak up the atmosphere. A short walk from the main streets and from Cafe Tortoni.  There was a musical audition on when I was there that only added to the experience. Great social place to eat and chat the afternoon away, and downstairs there are billard tables - full of history and life."
"December 5, 2013",20,Where tango dreams go to die,"I made a reservation based on others' reviews. I was expecting dancing and music. It wasn't until we were at the door that I was informed that it was music only. Had they told me that when I made the reservation, I would have looked elsewhere. Finding out at 9:00 PM on my last night in the city that I wasn't going to see dancing was a bitter pill to swallow. I really had no choice as all the other tango venues were probably full. So we stayed. The food was beyond mediocre. My ribeye was prepared to a perfect medium rare, but it was barely seasoned. The potato gratin side tasted like cardboard. The wine selection was quite weak as well. My date had a very uninspired salad. Blah. The music was laughable. I try to live with no regrets, but this experience is really testing my ability to do so. So, if you want to waste your precious time and money, go to 36 Billares!!! They will deliver."
"March 29, 2013",40,Worth Visiting!,"A 100 year old bar/caf√©, that has every night tango shows. The show are quiet typical, not not that ""broadway"" style you can get in other places on the city.

"March 7, 2013",40,Great traditional argentinian italian spot,"My husband and i went to Los 36 Billares as they were advertising a traditional tango show on a Wednesday night for $50 pesos per person. We were not disappointed - the place had a great, warm atmosphere and basic reasonably priced italian influenced menu (they also had a special tango menu for $50 pesos). The guest performer of the evenings show, Daniel Alexis, came up to speak to us when we arrived and explained how the night would run. We ordered some wine and watched the show which ran for 2 hours and had an orchestra, maestro, tango dancers and of course the singer which was Daniel. We shared a gnocci which was tasty and fresh. Guests were also invited to participate in the show. Would recommend a visit here."
"December 27, 2012",20,?,I know the place was famous once but now I just don't understand. I found it in the guide book and was disappointed. Plenty of other spots to stop on Avenida de Mayo.
"March 28, 2012",50,nice local atmosphere,"We stopped here for cafe con leche one morning and ended up coming back for the dinner and show that night. The 4 piece band was fabulous but there was no dancing for the tango music. Make sure if you book reservations that there will be dancing if that is what you want to see. Many locals, which we really enjoyed. I would return on a night when they have dancing with the music."

It's a very small place with no tables, you eat your pizza standing up next to a bar with a glass of good beer. I could barely eat two slices, you won't believe the amount of cheese they put on this pizza. They even have to put wood blocks to the sides of the pizza after they cut a slice to keep the chesse inside of it. It is AMAZING! And it is always packed! You can also eat other kind of pizzas and empanadas and they have delivery. It became one of my favorite places to eat in the world ;-)"

"February 13, 2012",40,Great Pizza,Great Pizza in an old and characteristic Pizzeria. Well known in Buenos Aires since decades. Sometimes you have to wait for a table
"January 31, 2012",50,excellent local pizza,"Cool atmosphere, reasonable prices. About as authentic as Argentine pizza gets!"
"January 16, 2012",50,One of the top Pizzerias,"Along with Guerrin, Los Inmortales, Burgio, Angelin and Las Cuartetas this is a pizzeria you must go. You can have a portion on the bar, don't need to sit to eat a full pizza"
"January 11, 2012",50,The BEST FUGAZZETA pizza in Buenos Aires,"Really, once with some friends, we went to 7 different places, the objective was clear: finding the best fugazzerta, and this is it! Plus, the atmosphere is very local. The other pizzas are ok, but FUGAZZETA.... √±ami!"
"January 9, 2012",50,A real delight,"""El Cuartito"" is the best place to try the true Argentina pizza and ""empanadas"". It's a bit crowdy at weekends, but it's definitely a must if you're in BA."
"January 5, 2012",40,One of my top choices,"This is second on my list for pizza, after Los inmortales. Dont miss their pizza called ""At√≥mica""....hot hot hot"
"December 28, 2011",30,A classic,"A classic Pizza place in Bs As, more famous I guess by its old decor rather than for the pizza itself. Ok if you are around, not worth the trip if you are not in the area."
"December 24, 2011",40,Wonderful yummy pizza!,"I don't even like pizza, but loved this place. The fugazetta (which is really just focaccia Argentine-style) was lovely. It's cheap, yummy pizza. Definitely an experience worth adding to the list!"

The pizza was good (portenos like a very thick and kind of toasty crust) but it was not the best I have ever had. We also ordered the faina to put on top which was a fun novelty but not necessary for sure. I had the flan with dulce del leche cream for dessert which was quite nice.

I first dine at Los Inmortales some 35 years ago, with my future wife and my parents. That was a real ""fiesta"" of the best pizza I knew. We always joke at home that on that time we left the last triangle of pizza because we have ate too much, and we still miss that piece of pizza!. Last July I visit the same location of Los Inmortales with my wife and my 24 years old son. The place looks terrific: still with the Old Buenos Aires Tango look and still with the best pizza you can find anywhere, even compared with Italy itself. If you are in Buenos Aires, a visit to Los Inmortales is a must. You will be rewarded by food and service that will remain with you for a long time."

But, like Bugs Bunny used to say... ""That's all folks"". The food is very regular. I ate a medium four cheeses pizza and it was extremely salty. The size was very big and I asked for a doggy bag. But they gave me the pizza folded into itself in a plastic (and thin) bag! The service was very slow. We had to stand up and almost scream to get our bill (and the place was empty!!!) The waiters were playing on the phone, talking each others and no paying attention at all to the public. We went there, took our classic picture of the place and we will never get back."

"April 25, 2016",50,Best pizza in Buenos Aires,"In ""Las Cuartetas"" you can taste the best pizza in Buenos Aires. This place is not so beautifull but they have in my opinion the best muzzarella pizza in town. If you like wide mass and a lot of muzzarella, go to Las Cuartetas."
