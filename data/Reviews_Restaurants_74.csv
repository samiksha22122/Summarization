"July 29, 2016",40,Great pizza,Had a really great pizza here in a tucked away restaurant behind Hopbarnhoff station. Good service and due to large size of pizza was able to have two different halves and share. Baked fresh with plenty of topping options and nice and thin.

"March 5, 2016",50,Cool place with great pizza but better make a reservation,The place is really cool in terms of interior design and the pizza is awesome (and really big). Better make a reservation to avoid waiting for 30 mins or so. It's good for dinners with friends and for couples too.

"June 4, 2011",50,Biggest pizza ever?,This place is great! The food was nice and the pizzas enormous. By munich standards the prices are very cheap and the atmosphere was really good. Definitely worth a visit when you can't face another sausage! would advise advanced booking as this place is really busy even on a weekday.
"February 13, 2011",40,for those who like big pizza,"A nice pizzeria with a terrace on the Leopoldstr in Munich - probably one of few places I would recommend to go in, if you're a tourist in Munich. You get huge pizza there, so for the pizza-fans it is a good place. They offer quite a big variety of pizzas, so for sure you'll find one, which you like. It is a nice place to go there with a couple of friends, but nothing special. It is mostly quite full, so I would make a reservation to be sure to get a seat."
"January 29, 2011",50,Worth the wait time!!,with no reservations on sat night---the wait time was worth it. Second time to L'Osteria pizza from dec. 2006 and both times food and staff were great at a low price. wish we had them in Houston.
"January 23, 2011",40,Delicious Pizza,"L'osteria is a Pizza/Pasta chain in Bavaria. This chain idea may be putting some off, but they really do very good and big pizza for a reasonable price as well. I never tried the Pasta there but Pizzas are delicious and recommendable. It's not a romantic Italian, more like a casual, pop in Pizzeria. Therefore the atmosphere is rather busy. Service is okay."
"August 27, 2010",40,Good pizza,"Good pizza, decent service. Has a large outdoor area that's very pleasant for sitting on a summer's evening."
"August 20, 2010",40,Delicious pizzas,"Authentic italian pastas, pizzas and dessets. For the pizzas, I highly recommend the Rucola, Hawaii and Fungi pizzas. Since the pizzas are huge, you can opt for half a pizza, in that way, you can eat more varieties of them too :) For dessert, both the Tiramisu and Tartufo are optimal choices. This is a highly popular place especially on Fri and Sat nights, so do come early, alternatively call them to make a reservation beforehand."
"August 2, 2010",50,A very nice place to spend some time during Summer,"It is a very popular Pizzeria amongst students in Munich and always very full during the summer period. 1. Food: The food is in no way special or exquisit, but the ingredients are fresh, the pizzas are huge (40 cm. diameter) and very tasty. I have tried almost all pastas, but I haven't been really impressed - I would say average taste. The pizzas, as already mentioned, are huge. This is due to the fact that the dough is very thing (really italian), but still it will make you feel full. There is really no place in Munich, where you get so much food for so little money (except Pasta-e-Basta and maybe some all-you-can eat places). 2. Preis-Quality Just look at the last sentence :) 3. Place and Atmosphere - I would say nothing special. If you go in the summer, make sure to sit in the garden - it is situated on one of the most ""famous"" streets in Munich - Leopolodstra√üe and it is really nice. 4. Service Average. Waiting times were kind of long everytime I have visitied the place, even during non-rishhour times (15:00, 16:00). You normally weight a little bit longer for someone to take your order and for the bill, the food is cooked really fast. 5. Visitors Mostly young people and businessmen from the nearby offices. Visitors have different origins and it is easy to meet new people, as tables are really cousy and close to each other, so you can easily jump into the conversation of the next table (don't do it, if the next table is occupied by german omas :)) 6. Prices Per person - I would say it really depends on what you order. Pizza prices are between 7.5 - 11 euros, beer costs 3-4 EUR, so if you just go for a beer and a pizza ,15 EUR should be ok. If you eat a salad and a dessert (Tiramisu is really, really good!), then you might need 25 EUR. I have not attached fotos, but you can find plenty of pictures on the website."

"June 23, 2017",50,Amazing food and service for a local restaurant!,"On a whim, I had lunch here while waiting for an appointment in the local area. Have to admit, this food is incredible! And the staff is very friendly and helpful. Decorated with automobile memorabilia, sitting inside and outside, the food is fresh and made to order. The combination of spices and tastes are highly matched, and the presentation is like artwork. I thought I might be in a michelin star restaurant, it was that good. Prices match the quality and amount of food. I was pleasantly surprised and so happy to have found this amazing little local place. Definitely, make the trip to this place! And there is free parking all around with space available during most of the day. I will be back!!"
