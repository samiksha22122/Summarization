"December 11, 2019",50,Remarkable food and impeccable service,Steaks and grills were superb. Service was impeccable. I would not mind going back to it next time we visit SF. Place has a relaxed atmosphere. The views of the Bay Bridge from the restaurant was just fantastic too.
"October 22, 2019",50,Magnificent,"Had a great time with the family. Will definitely do it again whenever possible. Location, view, service, staff were all fantastic..!!! Thank you..!!!"
"October 11, 2019",40,Great but a tad pricey and touristy,Spectacular location overlooking Bay Bridge. Stroll the bay front. Great terrace - grab it if not too cold. Solid steakhouse menu. Sister restaurant WaterBar is also buzzing next door. Short pleasant walk from downtown.
"September 19, 2019",50,Lovely Location,"It’s really nice in the night... under the Bay bridge the view so great... great food , service at the bar was exceptional... place is really good to host a business dinner.."
"July 28, 2019",50,Great food and views,We were recommended to go here for dinner to see the lights on the Bay Bridge. Was not disappointed at all. We sat out on the balcony and had a wonderful evening. Recommend you book to ensure a table though.
"July 13, 2019",50,Beautiful views and delicious food!,We enjoyed a great group dinner here. A clear night so beautiful views of the bridge and lots of people walking by on the path. Delicious steak and potatoes! Lemon risotto was way too lemony. Loved the chocolate ice box cake. Great wine selections.
"July 3, 2019",40,Lovely Setting,Scallops were delicious. Personally did not care for the vegetables as they were either too spicy (broccoli) or too bland (green beans) the steak I am told was as delicious.
"May 26, 2019",50,Epic it is,"Epic it is, I've try the T Bone with Lobster, at the bar and it was really really tasty.The view if you seat close to the window is also great but the overall restaurant is very pleasant."
"May 21, 2019",50,Awesome venue and food choices,"We had a wonderful dinner at EPIC - and it was EPIC. Loved the location, the water view was wonderful. Steak and apps were perfect and delicious."

"February 12, 2019",50,Impossible Burger,The meatless Impossible Burger (the newer recipe) is served here. It’s a delicious alternative to beef patties and a great option for those who want to avoid meat.
"March 28, 2019",40,Steak and fresh seafood,Five for dinner at 6:30pm and the place was already very busy. It is well organized and operated and everything went smoothly with no sense of being rushed or hurried. The seafood indulgence platter was fantastic and the grilled octopus was the best I’ve ever...More
"March 17, 2019",50,"The perfect view, and the food is good!","Typically when you have an awesome view, the restaurant is average. This is not the case! First, I would highly recommend you allow some extra time pre or post dinner to walk along the Embarcadero. The lights of the city are truly amazing! Then step into a lively restaurant which has traditional steak house wines, drinks and menu. The dishes are all done very well, and don’t disappoint. They try and get creative w an apple salad, which is a fun twist. The atmosphere both inside and out make this a special evening."
"March 17, 2019",40,Dinner for the mothers,"I'll start with great flavor and tender cuts. Great flavor. The prices are high, but it's a high end restaurant. Good size cuts and you do not leave hungry. The fritto misto wasnt the greatest I've had. Little to dry. The sides available had good flavor and portion size is enough for two or more. Wine and cocktail selection is good. I only gave a four rating due to appetizer not being up to par for price."
"March 10, 2019",30,"Overpriced, not great steaks","The positive things with the restaurant is the outside terrace and the great view on the Bay Bridge and the Baywalk. The steaks were hard to cut, with a lot of fat. No real greens apart from sprouts. We ordered mushrooms, which were quite overcooked. Still looking for the best Steakhouse in San Francisco."
"March 10, 2019",40,Solid dinner as part of a conference,Had the short ribs and they were very good. Knocked a star as the risotto starter wasn't the greatest... basically cheese and risotto. The dessert was pretty good as well but a very different version of an apple pie. The service was excellent and attentive and the views were simply unapproachable beneath the bridge... stellar views.
"March 8, 2019",50,Great food - wonderful location,"Went for lunch Las week. The food was terrific, a Expensive but the steak was perfection. Everything we has was marvelous including top notched service. It’s well situated in the Embarcadero with a great view of the bay bridge. Come for the food and stay to dine. It’s wonderful."
"February 23, 2019",50,Mouthwatering experience,Epic certainly lived up to its name! All of the food was amazingly delicious - and the view of the bridge really set the atmosphere. The service was also too notch. I’d highly recommend!
"February 12, 2019",50,Impossible Burger,The meatless Impossible Burger (the newer recipe) is served here. It’s a delicious alternative to beef patties and a great option for those who want to avoid meat.
"February 7, 2019",50,AMAZING,Had dinner here 2 weeks ago while in town for a convention and it was amazing. The food was beyond excellent and the service was unmatched. I've eaten in many many steakhouses around the country and this is top 3. If ever back in San Fran will 100% eat here again!
"February 5, 2019",50,As Good As I Remembered,"Often times we go to a restaurant and have a terrific meal and rave about it. Then, in our enthusiasm we go back only to be disappointed as it not being quite what we remembered. That is not the case with Epic Steak. We recently returned and it was every bit as good as in our previous visit. This time we ordered Rack of Lamb along with the Julia Child potatoes (a must order). The rack was cooked to perfection and, since we were splitting the order, delivered each of us our own plate rather than our having to do it ourselves. Great ambiance, service, and food. What more could you ask for?"
"February 2, 2019",30,Not the best,This place was just OK. We were a party of three and one meal was sent back and the others were marginal at best. The view is the best part but be prepared for lots of large parties and a very loud experience.
"December 28, 2018",50,2nd visit in 2 years.....still excelent,"Great food, great view, great service. Perfectly cooked steak. Wonderful sides. All in all a great experience and meal. Definitely worth going to."

"November 8, 2018",40,Great steak,"Great steak and view of the Bay Bridge. Malbec wine delicious. Bar staff friendly. Calamari pretty average, but overall definitely worth a visit if you can afford it."
"October 27, 2018",50,OUTSTANDING,"We sat on the patio with a superb view of the Bay Bridge, sunset was glorious. My salmon was absolute perfection. Perfect flavors, presentation. My hubby’s fish was excellent. The Brussels sprouts are insane!!!! Would HIGHLY recommend."
"October 23, 2018",40,Great steak,Visited again last night - if you want great steak and great napa wine this the place to go. Great views of illuminated bay bridge and highest quality ingredients - have been several times since it opened 10 years ago
"October 7, 2018",40,"Epic Food, Epic View, good wine, Epic Prices","The food is very good, but sit on the terrace and enjoy the spectacular view of the bay bridge and the lighting display. The service is very good, wines are good but be prepared to pay high prices for the view."

"September 12, 2018",40,"Good food, good service!","I really like the setting next to the Bay Bridge and the interior is nice and makes it feel a bit luxurious. Oysters and meat are good, but not outstanding. Overall a nice place to go to."
"September 12, 2018",40,Joint birthday celebration,On the basis of the food this would be a 5 but it is pretty expensive so I accounted for this Steaks beautifully cooked and goes well with one of the various seafood based starters Wine list is extensive and some very pricey bottles
"September 10, 2018",50,Consistent Excellence,"Consistently excellent. Epic is a go-to for special occasions and a splurge dinner. Steak is always perfectly prepared, love the design-it-yourself salad, and the wine list is to die for! Service was impeccable. It's spendy, but worth every penny!"
"August 20, 2018",50,"Holy awesome views, Batman!","This is where I had my first meal in San Francisco. Great start! Tasty good, super awesome staff (especially Jenn)! I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to return. Next time I’m in the city, I’ll stop by again."

"May 28, 2018",40,Great Place to grab a late night drink and view the Bay Bridge,When in San Francisco stop by for an Epic view of the Bay Bridge.

"April 27, 2018",30,"Good good, wonderful view, Service below average","We enjoyed a good dinner with really nice views of the bridge tonight. While quality of the food is good, the Service is just Not good and below other top restaurants we visited in SF."
"March 4, 2018",50,Club managers dinner,Group of 11 and the food and service were excellent. Certainly not inexpensive as you can expect 100 + person without liquor. The view is absolutely spectacular.
"January 31, 2018",30,Great view and Service but not the food,"The view is really nice for an special occasion, but my steak was burned the mojito tasteless and the sides extremely small with not a verity of selection (no mash potatoes in steakhouse)"

"December 30, 2015",40,Pricey steaks on a beautiful spot,"Nice place, Good food, excellent service BUT Overpriced If you are going to charge $100-200 for a piece of meat it must be memorable, but it wasn't.

"August 13, 2013",50,Exquisite dinner with views of bay bridge lights,We walked up and were able to get seated right away. Everything from the service to the food was top notch. Only thing was it is a bit loud in the dining area. Good view of the lights on the bay bridge.

"May 30, 2013",40,good food & good views,The seafood apps were great - softshell crab and halibut ceviche. Braised short ribs were amazingly tender and flavourful. The wine list was heavy on Pinot's so we went with an Italian instead - a bit disappointing for being in SF. Overall a great meal.

"April 18, 2013",50,Best steak in SF?,"Located near the Bay Bridge this tribute to sandstone and timber presents diners with sensational steaks, sides and an extensive wine list. The look and feel is reminiscent of Wildfire in Sydney. As a group of five seasoned Aussie diners, we loved it."
"April 14, 2013",40,Very nice brunch,"Great views of Bay Bridge, excellent outdoor seating. Food is good (we only had brunch), recommend to try steak tartar. Excellent drinks. Love their beignets, but it's 50-50 - sometimes they are as good as New Orleans and sometimes they are very under-cooked."
"April 7, 2013",40,Nice view,The service was good and the waitress was extremely friendly. I always like dinning at Epic either on the main floor or the second floor which is not as formal. This is a great restaurant for Sunday brunch.

"November 2, 2011",40,Great location with a lot of street noise,Great new eatery with reasonably sized portions. The location right under the Bay Bridge makes it a bit noisy when you sit outside. The view is worth it though.

"July 28, 2011",40,The view alone is worth the trip,"View of the Bay Bridge and the updtairs bar scene is great at the Epic. Dinner was very good, a bit pricey and the wine salmonier was pertencious. Service was right on. There is better to eat in SF but this is not a dissapointment."

"March 13, 2008",10,Epically.....BAD,"I met some coworkers at Epic to celebrate a birthday. The view is very nice of the Bay Bridge. I suggest walking by the restaurant sometime so you can see what a great view they have... but keep walking!  Nobody in the restaurant really seemed to know what they were doing. My six oysters I ordered were... ok. The shucker kind of butchered them getting them open but, hey, thats the way it goes sometimes. The food runners seemed to be in constant confusion the whole time we were there. No big deal. My warm spinach salad was not terrible, but it certainly wasn't impressive. The funny thing is, amongst the six of us who ordered, my salad looked the best. I though everyone else's food looked unappetizing and it turned out nobody really liked their food that much. The salad the guy next to me was eating looked like a food prop from Les Miserables... not a good thing when you're paying enough to buy a seat to see the show itself.  When we got the bill there was an additional 4% charge to pay for the staff medical plan. OK, fine. I'm not coming back, anyway.  Here's kicker #1. In spite of the bad time we had at EPIC Roasthouse, we all chipped in and came up with a 18% tip. When the server came back, she told us that the manager was adding an additional amount (I don't remember exactly how much...maybe $15) to our check because we didn't tip enough. I'm not making this up! We had a very unpleasant experience, tipped 18%, and were being told that we needed to cough up more money! Unbelievable. This place is lacking in class I feel bad for them.  Kicker#2, and the reason I am writing this... I just checked my credit card account and found out that the restaurant charged an additional $140 to my card after I left!!!!! I give this place 6 months, if that.  I'll stick with The Fish Market for my seafood."

"August 7, 2020",30,Great place for a steak,"We just loved it - the service was great - maybe because the restaurant was less than 1/4-full. But anyway, the steak, the wine and the sides was just top-notch and this is an invitation for another Morton's anywhere in the US"
"March 5, 2020",40,hungry for Meat,This is an very old establishment and their known for their stakes. But if you want a good steak this should do it for you.

"August 24, 2017",30,Beautiful food - average service,The food was beautiful (steak tacos and pork chop) but we didn't feel the price justified what we got ($14 for a side dish?!?!) and staff service was average at best. Very condescending.
"August 21, 2017",50,Beautiful steak,"We had a beautiful steak at Morton's the service was wonderful, food was on the pricey side but the steak was fresh and cooked just as we liked."

"June 11, 2017",30,"Good, not great","This was my first visit to a Morton's and I suspect that it may very well be my last. The meat was good, no question, the service attentive but for the price, it just didn't live up to its name which is a shame."
"May 29, 2017",20,Steak was Overcooked.,Disappointing. Expensive steakhouse that did not meet expectations. Service was slow and. It very friendly. Requested medium rare steak. Steak was cooked medium to well done. There are fee better steakhouses in San Francisco.

"April 23, 2017",50,Classic old style steak house,What's not to like? Enjoy a scrumptious meal and walk about the fun sights of downtown. You have to like an old school vibe and menu with basic but yummy eats.
"April 18, 2017",50,Pricey - but worth it,I went to Morten's to celebrate my last night with my parents before going back home to Norway. Morten's was a great way to end our trip with amazing steak and some good drinks.

"August 2, 2016",40,"Great spot for happy hour, appetizers",Mortons has moved to the ground level (used to be in the basement) with a great bar area. Happy hour and happy hour appetizers make a great easy/early dinner - with nice windows overlooking the busy street life. Good location just off of Union Square.
"July 30, 2016",10,Scandalous,I have never seen such attitude at the reception desk overstuffed attitude and arrogance Timing to have food is unacceptable no body care Avoid this restaurant
"July 25, 2016",40,An institution in SF,I don't eat meat but was very happy with my fish. The service was very friendly and the wine was good. Not sure why they have a security guy with a wooly hat....

"July 15, 2016",40,"It's expensive, but if you like steak. . . .","Wonderful if you like steak and want to pay the price. Please don't take a date that will order seafood, pasta, or some other dish!!

"June 5, 2016",40,Good food but try not to sit near the kitchens,The food was good however our dining experience was slightly overshadowed by being sat by the serving hatch because the wait staff tended to gather here and chat which meant that we could not hear our own conversation.
"May 20, 2016",50,Best stake in the Sfo,Excellent food quality. Was in San Franisco for 4 nigyts and had dinner twice. The fillet on the bone was the choice order. A bit pricey bit worth the experience.

"April 28, 2016",30,Excellent if you don't mind the expense.,"Great location, right in Union Square. Food, service, and atmosphere were very good. But honestly, it was overpriced. With so many fine restaurants in San Francisco to choose from, I don't think it was worth that level of pricing."

"April 13, 2016",40,An Oasis Away from the Street,"Morton's may be a chain, but the character of each location is a bit unique. The San Francisco location is just off the chaos of Union Square and is designed to lower your blood pressure so you can enjoy good service and food."
"April 8, 2016",50,Best!,One of the best steak Houses in the US. Nice and well cooked meat with delicious side dishes. There is a Nice wine list too.
"April 6, 2016",40,good location and close from our hotel,right on union square! meat was fantastic and we end up full full full! I think my girlfriend already reviewed this restaurant but is one of the places I can remember from last year
"March 16, 2016",50,Good meat in San Francisco !,"Definitively, one of the best restaurants in SF when it comes to meat. If you are around i cannot but recommend to stop by. It's really worth it."

"January 17, 2016",40,Business lunch,Great service for or lunch. In and out in less than an hour without a sense of being rushed. Good was good. Setting a little noises due to table density in rear of resteraunt
"January 17, 2016",50,Great steak and service,I had a very nice steak at Morton's. As a starter I had Oysters and liked those as well. Service was something I really liked at Morton's!
"January 8, 2016",50,Excellent even if no steak eaten,"My wife and I didn't feel like steak but went here anyway. The lobster bisque and the lump crab cakes were amazing, excellent service. The restaurant was well designed with a good bar and lovely eating area. A must for all visitors to SFO"
"December 29, 2015",30,Not the typical great meal,Very disappointed in the mediocre quality and service we received while dining at a Mortons! Steak was touch and sides were dry. Not a meal you would expect in San Francisco. Very expensive as well!

"December 14, 2015",50,Brilliant would recommend,Just off Union Square. Staff where very helpful and friendly. We had drinks at bar first before got shown to our table. Waiters knowledge was brilliant Great service. Well priced would recommend to anyone that loves there steak.
"November 24, 2015",40,A high end dining experience at union square,We dined at the bar area due to the full reservation list. We coildnt wait so we ordered and enjoyed steaks. Its so mouthwatering and very well complimented by the red wine we ordered. The ambiance is really cozy too.

"October 26, 2015",10,Disappointing,The worst steak experience ever. Asking for a medium cooked steak resulted in a dry well done piece of meat. Giving the chef a second chance resulted in raw meat and cold sides. Not as expected.
"October 13, 2015",40,The bread is a meal in itself!,We had a meal here on first night of our stay as it was very close to our hotel. VERY expensive but good service and good steak. But I think very overpriced!

The bar area has good drinks options and the starters were very good. I had the Seafood Soup, Salad and the Chicken Stake, which were good. I heard from the guest that the stakes were good and well cooked."
"September 20, 2015",50,nothing short of Perfection,"Arrived for a corporate dinner here. The party consisted of over 40 people, but the food was served to perfection.

The staff are so friendly and welcoming, steaks are amazing and it's good value for money.  The truffle fries are a must but definitely only order 2 sides between 2 as they are huge!!"
"September 10, 2015",50,Dinner,"We are staying in SF for a few days and happened to see the sign. Had never had the chance to eat at a Morton's, so we decided it was time.

"September 10, 2015",50,Absolutely outstanding,"From the service and the atmosphere to the food and wine, this restaurant is absolutely outstanding!

"August 12, 2015",30,Good steaks but is it worth it?,I find the steaks excellent but I find the prices over the top for what you get. EVERYTHING is extra.......not impressed and we did try it 3 time
"August 12, 2015",40,Good steak,"Although there are many Morton's across the country, this was the first time we had eaten at one. We enjoyed everything, just probably not worth the $250 we spent (no drinks!)"
"August 1, 2015",50,Meat eaters delight - careful in SF,"can't go wrong, expect to pay for goodness. The Steaks are incredible, and the service is right on every time for me."

"July 9, 2015",50,Sensational,The meals and service here are absolutely fantastic. People seated next to us were of same opinion. It is expensive but well worth it. You will not be disappointed.
"June 20, 2015",30,"Too expensive, nothing special",Too expensive and quality of food nothing special. Ambience too dark. Wine was good. But 140$ is too much for what you get
"June 19, 2015",40,Its still the best steak in town,"Hands down, may be the most expensive,but the steaks are the best. What else can I say. I would rather have 2 steaks a year here at $60 than 6 at $25 elsewhere."

"April 29, 2015",50,Five Star Steak for Five Star Price,Delicious Steak if you don't mind paying minimum of $50 bucks for steak only! No sides included. Service was top notch. Sides was nothing to write home about. Shrimp dish was just okay.

"July 2, 2013",50,A known,We have dined in several Morton's in different cities over the years including the original in Chicago. This restaurant provides the food quality and service we expected; we had a great evening.
"June 24, 2013",50,Steaks and more in San Francisco,Fiorst time at this Morton's. Not disappointed. Great service and the food was good as always. Expensive and not someplace that you drop in. But if you are looking for a great meal definitely put morton's on the list.
"June 24, 2013",20,Burned steak !,You would think a steak house would know how to cook the inside of a steak without buring the outside!

I had never been to San Francisco before (live in San Diego)...wonderful trip!"

"March 24, 2013",30,Good service,The steak was ok but priced too high for the quality. However the service was excellent. Wine selection was great and the atmosphere was good.
"March 23, 2013",10,Not impressed,"Overpriced and Corporate. As far as chain restaurants go, I suppose it is on of the better ones. I would rather get a Steak in the Marina District."
"March 22, 2013",40,We Enjoyed our Visit!,"We ordered salmon and chicken, which we know you're not supposed to do at a steakhouse. :) But they were delicious! Our waitress was friendly and courteous, made us feel very welcome. We would definitely visit this restaurant again!"
"March 7, 2013",30,Good place for drinks...food medicore,Good place for drinks...food medicore. They serve a good steak and drinks are drinks are generous but isn't that what you expect from a steak restaurant? Nothing outstanding.
"March 5, 2013",50,A Great Steak!,We found this restaurant because we took a tour that picked up out front. We had a wonderful experience at Morton's. The wait staff was so professional. A must do!

"February 25, 2013",30,Very expensive steak,"The steak is excellent and very expensive and all of the sides are fairly ordinary. A steak lovers delight, but otherwise, there are better alternatives."
"January 28, 2013",30,very expensive and the steaks are ok but no wow factor,good steaks at a very expensive price and frankly not worth the price they charge for dinner. Too many good places which charge half what Mortons does.
"January 28, 2013",50,Best place ever!,"The food is amazinggggg! This is the best restaurant I have ever visited, even though the restaurant doesn't look that nice from the outside, it is a different world on the inside!"
"January 16, 2013",40,True to the brand,Morton's is a good steak place. One of the things that I like best is the consistency of the food. It's a little pricey but no more than other steakhouses you could choose.
"December 11, 2012",40,Very good steakhouse,"We were served by a friendly, professional staff. Food was expensive, but it was definitely a cut above the usual. One of our party had a salad, which looked quite uninspiring, but if you come to Morton's you should probably be having steak..."
"December 9, 2012",40,Proper steakhouse,"Good, chunky, tasty steaks. Good atmosphere, although best to book. Wine list is OK but could be expanded. Service was good and efficient, and food was appreciated by everyone."
"November 22, 2012",50,Superb,Everything was fantastic. I ordered a drink i didn't care for and it was quickly taken care of and a new drink that I loved was brought out. Our food was all fabulous and the ambiance was great as well.
"November 17, 2012",20,"Ok, but overpriced","I fully agree with herzoke's review. Nothing special for the food, but very high prices. Atmosphere not really cozy, very loud. A glass of average red wine for 16 USD is just rip-off."
"November 16, 2012",40,great steak,Had the steak and lobster special for $50 and it was awesome. Not a fan of how you have to order sides separately.
"November 10, 2012",50,"The ""Blued"" 8 oz. Filet was Incredible!","The Morton' on Post in San Fran is fantastic. Not only was the food delicious, the staff was wonderful making it a wonderful dining experience."
"November 8, 2012",50,Great Food and Service,"This place was wonderfull, great staff and entertainment. We arrived early and the barman advised that we wait 10 minutes and then our food would be approx $20 ( between the 2 of us) cheaper - Recommend"
"November 5, 2012",50,traditionally good,"You can't go wrong with Morton's Steak House. Traditionally they have the knack for making the best steak in the industry. The service is top knotch, the people are friendly, the food is fantastic.."

"October 8, 2012",10,Plenty of other places to eat,$150 for a main course for 2 and two glasses of wine. Service was mediocre. There are far better places to eat and you should choose them.
"October 2, 2012",50,Chain restaurant but outstanding,Service here was impeccable. The food was Mortons and excellent. Great location just across the street. Didn't have to bother with cab or trolley for a great meal.
"October 1, 2012",50,Honeymoon night out!,"The food was incredible, the service impeccable. We got a seat without a reservation with little wait. Our waitress, Erica was both knowledgeable and personable. The menu is family style and price was right on line with similar dining establishments."
"October 20, 2012",50,A great place for food,"On entering we were greeted warmly and given the choice of either the dining room or bar to eat, we chose the dining room. The wait staff were very friendly and helpfull even pointing out the starters were huge and informed us the kitchen would...More"
"October 15, 2012",10,So much for service!,"We arrived cold, tired and hungry. The staff were snooty, looking down upon us and smarmly suggesting that we book next time. The place was not busy and there will not be a next time! We contemplated walking out, but decided to stay. With hindsight, wish we had gone elsewhere. All through the meal we were made to feel unwelcome and unwanted....staff were chatting to themselves and sneering at other customers. You have been warned!"
"October 10, 2012",50,Best Place for Visiting Family,"Great place to take meat and potatoes visitors. Food is good, service is great, and wine list is outstanding."
"October 9, 2012",50,The best Mac and Cheese EVER!!,We visited Mortons on the last night of our three night stay in San Francisco and it was great! We had a short wait for a table at the bustling bar and then we were seated at our table. Learning from previous mistakes o portion sizes in the USA we went straight for the main course. We both had the 6oz Fillet Mignon and I had the chopped spinach salad with bacon dressing and my partner had the mac and cheese. Only a short wait for the food and when it came it was great the steak was cooked perfectly and the salad was awesome but the mac and cheese was the star of the show. This is a great restaurant and well worth a visit if you are in San Fran.
"October 8, 2012",10,Plenty of other places to eat,$150 for a main course for 2 and two glasses of wine. Service was mediocre. There are far better places to eat and you should choose them.
"October 5, 2012",40,Worth it if you have an Expense Account,"The only reason to come in Morton's in my opinion is if you have an expense account or it's a business lunch/dinner. Since I didn't have to fork out the moola, let's go!  Steaks are in the $50 and up range so prepare for some serious damage to the wallet. I did like the fact they have ""slightly smaller"" steaks,which for me, are the perfect size. With sides like mushrooms,potatoes and those giant broccoli, that's more than a meal. The steak was nicely done with the right amount of smokiness and ""burntness"" outside but still tender and rare inside.  Tried the chocolate mousse dessert - if you're a chocoholic, this is the one to get. It's fantastically good. Biblically good.  Service was top notch except it was slow. We must've waited for 45 minutes before our steaks made their appearance only to disappear again in 15 minutes into our ravenous bellies."
"October 2, 2012",50,Chain restaurant but outstanding,Service here was impeccable. The food was Mortons and excellent. Great location just across the street. Didn't have to bother with cab or trolley for a great meal.

"September 27, 2012",40,Great Steakhouse!,"We ate at Morton's this week and enjoyed every minute of it. Food was great, service excellent and the location is of course unbeatable, so close to the heart of San Francisco. While it was a very busy evening in the restaurant, the staff was very caring and attentative. The steaks were excellent and so was the wine. I will be back!"
"September 24, 2012",30,Why reserve,"Morton's is known for quality and service. I reserved via on-line and my reservation was taken for an 11 p.m. dinner time. Upon my arrival, I was told it was a mistake and the system should have not taken it because they were now closing. I asked why would they not honor my 11 p.m. they stated it was a glicth. A very poor excuse. They finally relented but it should have not gone that far. My experience occurred on 08/04/12 and I'm still not happy about it because I expected more from them. I have been there many times. Food and service was never an issue."
"September 23, 2012",40,Peppercorn steak,Morton's known for the great steak did not disappoint in San Francisco. We were seated close to the kitchen so enjoyed watching the cook work the steaks. I had the peppercorn steak which just melted in my mouth.

"August 18, 2012",50,Consistently Great!,"I usually don't like chain restaraunts when I go on vacation. But, we do not have a Morton's where I live. So when I am in the same city as one I always visit. I have never been disappointed. They are always GREAT! Enjoyed"
"August 2, 2012",40,Old reliable,"Typical Morton's so you know what you are getting - steaks and more steaks. Excellent service, very good steaks done just as ordered. Good ambiance. Excellent loaf of bread to start."
"July 22, 2012",50,steak cooked to perfection,The food and service in this restaurant is wonderful. By far better service than any other Mortons. The food is good everywhere but the service here is amazing.
"July 15, 2012",10,Five star prices and one star quality... A big mistake!!!,It may look very smart and trendy but looks aren’t everything... The service was not very good and the food was a real rip-off... Five star prices and one star quality... I was ill after eating here... The only recommendation I'd give is STAY AWAY....
"June 29, 2012",40,In the City for a weekend,My wife and I spent the weekend in the City the hotel recommended this place for dinner. They made our reservations and drove us to dinner. The steaks and food was great with a very nice atmosphere. We are looking forward to another visit soon.

"June 6, 2012",40,An Always Excellent Choice,"If it is a steakhouse experience you want, you cannot go wrong with MORTON'S; classic decor compliments classic food and good service."
"June 1, 2012",50,Expensive but Great Meal,"Both of us had the Fillets, very nice, melt in the mouth. I had the Golden Mash which I felt was a bit bland but overall a great meal. The staff where very attentive and polite and we would eat there again."
"May 28, 2012",50,For a special nignt,"The restaraunt is easy to get to with public tranportation. Atmosphere is dynamic. Service, impeccable. Food is delicious although expensive and portions are enormous, need to offer half size portions. The bar is relaxing and the menu is delectable."

I go when I have a gift certificate to offset the very high tab I will rack up. They did a wonderful job on my husband's birthday and created a special menu page just for him. Steak, wine (including sommelier) and dessert were all amazing. You do, however, pay for all of this."
"October 17, 2007",20,Not a Steakhouse!,"I won't repeat what many have already said but, basically, don't go to Morton's in San Francisco if you are looking for a good steak. We decided to go there as we were looking forward to a good steak. Both of us had filet mignons. I ordered mine medium well and I started to be worried when the waiter told me that they would have to butterfly it to ensure proper cooking. A real steakhouse can cook a filet without having to butterfly it! It came to the table charred. The waiter took it away but was back within 2 minutes with a new one - from the steam and the liquid at the bottom of the plate, I could tell that this steak had been microwaved! I left it at that as I didn't want to spoil our evening any further. My husband ordered his medium-rare and. The cooking was ok but the steak was somewhat tasteless. Particularly compared to the filets we had the previous night at California Market in Carmel.  Morton's charges ridiculous prices for what they offer. I don't mind paying a lot of money for a good meal but, clearly, Morton's in San Francisco is charging way too much for the quality & the preparation of their food."
"August 9, 2007",50,It's worth it!,"Presentation, service and food are fantastic. You do indeed get what you're paying for! The raspberry souflle is the ""to-die-for"" dessert - even if the entrees are their signature menu items!"
"March 5, 2007",20,Sadly Disappointing,"As with other's, I had always read about the Morton's chain setting a standard for steaks so my wife and I were anxious to try and compare it to some of our other favorites such as Sullivans, Ruth Chris and Flemings.  The good: I found walking downstairs somewhat charming, like entering a private club, the atmosphere is plush with dark woods and glass with an inviting but seperate bar. The staff was attentive and friendly, the sourdough bread absolutely delicious, the service excellent.  The bad: Simply put, the steaks were totally unremarkable in terms of taste and flavor. My wife had the filet mignon ($38) and asked for it medium well, it arrived rare, they offered to ""re-fire"" it and it was returned medium rare, even our waiter was amazed and said this had never happened, rather than wait further, my wife said it was fine but could not eat all of it due to it being undercooked for her taste. The manager, even though we had not requested one, was gracious enough to come to our table and removed the charge which was appreciated. I had the strip steak at the recommendation of the waiter, it was prepared properly, medium well, however, both steaks lacked any true flavor and to be blunt were more on par with my own back yard attempts....not bad but not great and certainly no match for other premium steak houses. The $8 baked potatoes are certainly served with much flair with the waiter bringing out a condiments tray but were of a standard size, for $8 I was expecting something more substantial.  Dinner with 4 call drinks, and desert was $133, this was after my wife's steak was given gratis, but the point being, it just fair, not what I would call good and certainly not great."
"February 20, 2007",10,Don't waste your money....,"Let’s start off by saying….I should have known better!!!! I should have really taken under consideration the last review posted, but I questioned it and gave it the benefit of the doubt since the review was a year old. I made reservations for a post Valentine’s Day dinner with my husband. My husband is a typical Irish man that loves his meat and potatoes. I did experience the Morton’s in Chicago prior to me coming to this particular Morton’s. The Chicago Morton’s was spectacular – so I thought I’d give it a shot!  I made sure that we were seated away from the bar (advised by last reviewer). This is not a quiet restaurant and does get a bit rowdy. Maybe it was the 6 Texans on table 6 nearby us that gave us that impression, but who knows! The waitress was polite and very attentive, but she wasn’t a seasoned waitress. For an expensive dinner as such, she should have stepped up her game.  One positive experience – their presentation of the menu. Also, they do have an array of expensive wines. Food Tray: they bring out this cart with the “USDA” meats on one serving plate and talk about how good is the meat. Alongside the raw meat is a live lobster – that freaked out my husband and turned him off to order the lobster. His big black eyes gave him a mercy stare! It’s funny how they present an Idaho potato as if it were made in the moon. Blah, blah, blah, blah.  The meat wasn’t all that it was cracked up to be. I ordered a filet (butterfly cut) medium. It was horrible. A ½ hour after leaving the restaurant, I felt nauseous. My husband ordered the same thing, except his wasn’t butterfly cut, and his stomach felt sick all night. We think that the meat was old and/or a return from a previous customer. We also ordered 2 potatoes and some asparagus. UM, nothing special there…..Just a freakin’ potatoes and some asparagus they bought at Safeway! The crème Brule was terrible. I spent about $250.00 (tip included) for a terrible dinner – I’m not the best cook, but let me tell you…..I could have done better than that!"
"June 12, 2006",10,Before you descend underground...,"I visited the ""legandary"" Mortons Steakhouse - San Francisco back in January of 2006. I was very excited to visit, as I've read a lot about Morton's being touted as the ""best"" when it comes to a classic steakhouse. Although I've seen a lot on the internet, my experience was probably the worst experience at a restaurant in my entire life. Let me explain...  Walking in the door at Mortons in San Francisco is kind of odd at first. I wasn't sure if I had indeed stepped in the correct door. I had to ask the valet outside if this was truly the famous ""Morton's."" ""Yes,"" he said. Apparently one has to descend a flight of stairs - and go underground - to eat at Mortons in San Francisco. ""Okay,"" I thought, ""its probably pretty cozy and very club-like."" Well.....Upon seating at our table which was located 15 feet from the bar, we were jolted awake by people screaming at the bar. And when I say screaming, I mean screaming. Of course, it was the NCAA tournament and I understand people get excited - but this type of behavior was best suited for a sports bar...The waiter approached our table in a very complacent manner, told us about Mortons, and how good its steaks were. He showed us the meat cart, which was kind of cool. The live lobster was a nice touch. Although I felt kind of awkward listening to how Mortons potatoes and tomatoes are the ""best around."" I think I grow good potatoes and tomatoes in my backyard.  The menu was a tad pricey. But oh well, its Mortons, its San Francisco, whatever. I found it interesting that the ""regular"" cut filet mignon (~6 oz.) was only $4 less than the double cut (10 oz). Of course, I got the 10 oz expecting a wonderful piece of meat. I ordered mine medium rare (as a filet should be cooked), as did my friend who was dining with me that evening. All the side dishes are a la carte at Mortons - but $7.50 for asparagus? $7.50 for mashed potatoes? We asked if the mashed potatoes had anything ""special"" to them. You know, toppings, blue cheese, garlic, etc. ""No, they're just regular mashed potatoes,"" the waiter said. $7.50? Come again? We ended up splitting an order of asparagus.  Ah yes, the meal. The filets: arrived looking charred on the outside. We got halfway through them, and found that the insides were extra rare. If Mortons doesn't have the means to cook a medium rare, 10 oz filet, then I suggest they find (a) a convection oven or (b) back off on the size of the filet. The asparagus: big, tough, and woody. It was served with this special sauce that was absolutely, 100% tasteless. It actually made me laugh.  The waiter had checked back with us on rare occasion. I actually had to go up to the bar and pull him away from the TV to get me something. When he came back to the table, I looked up at him, only to see his lips moving but his head facing the TV. When he noticed I was a little upset as the loud roar coming from the bar he said, ""Oh, its the NCAA final 4, I guess you have to expect that."" Sorry sir, not when I'm forking out $200 for a meal.  This was the absolute worst meal I've ever paid money for. I didn't want to cause a stir at the moment, but if I had to do it over again, I would've demanded every single penny back. It was awful. I have been looking for a Mortons e-mail address for a while now to express ridiculous this experience was, but I've come up empty handed. San Francisco has wonderful food. Go elsewhere."

"January 7, 2008",10,Definitely not my taste.,"We were expecting some good steaks from the famous morton's but it's a pity that it's a far cry from it.  The Morton's usual way of introducing the food was ok, but not as impressive as the one I've had at Dallas. The server indicated that he would come back to introduce us to their desserts, but he never did.  I ordered a medium rare ribeye steak, ok i'm not a steak expert, but I definitely have tried many other medium rare doneness steaks. The steak was so raw in the middle that i couldn't bear to swallow. My friend had her steak done medium rare as well, but hers was fine. On the whole, it was not tasty.  I've tried morton's at Dallas, Texas before. It was so much nicer than San Francisco's outlet. It was a disapointment, and money not worth spending."

I go when I have a gift certificate to offset the very high tab I will rack up. They did a wonderful job on my husband's birthday and created a special menu page just for him. Steak, wine (including sommelier) and dessert were all amazing. You do, however, pay for all of this."
"October 17, 2007",20,Not a Steakhouse!,"I won't repeat what many have already said but, basically, don't go to Morton's in San Francisco if you are looking for a good steak. We decided to go there as we were looking forward to a good steak. Both of us had filet mignons. I ordered mine medium well and I started to be worried when the waiter told me that they would have to butterfly it to ensure proper cooking. A real steakhouse can cook a filet without having to butterfly it! It came to the table charred. The waiter took it away but was back within 2 minutes with a new one - from the steam and the liquid at the bottom of the plate, I could tell that this steak had been microwaved! I left it at that as I didn't want to spoil our evening any further. My husband ordered his medium-rare and. The cooking was ok but the steak was somewhat tasteless. Particularly compared to the filets we had the previous night at California Market in Carmel.  Morton's charges ridiculous prices for what they offer. I don't mind paying a lot of money for a good meal but, clearly, Morton's in San Francisco is charging way too much for the quality & the preparation of their food."
"August 9, 2007",50,It's worth it!,"Presentation, service and food are fantastic. You do indeed get what you're paying for! The raspberry souflle is the ""to-die-for"" dessert - even if the entrees are their signature menu items!"
"March 5, 2007",20,Sadly Disappointing,"As with other's, I had always read about the Morton's chain setting a standard for steaks so my wife and I were anxious to try and compare it to some of our other favorites such as Sullivans, Ruth Chris and Flemings.  The good: I found walking downstairs somewhat charming, like entering a private club, the atmosphere is plush with dark woods and glass with an inviting but seperate bar. The staff was attentive and friendly, the sourdough bread absolutely delicious, the service excellent.  The bad: Simply put, the steaks were totally unremarkable in terms of taste and flavor. My wife had the filet mignon ($38) and asked for it medium well, it arrived rare, they offered to ""re-fire"" it and it was returned medium rare, even our waiter was amazed and said this had never happened, rather than wait further, my wife said it was fine but could not eat all of it due to it being undercooked for her taste.
