"February 8, 2017",30,"""Steak"" house?","Good service, great atmosphere, good offer of drinks but mixed feeling regarding food - medium steak was well done, flat and thin as paper. Hamburger, why hamburger in steakhouse?, was in standard quality - nothing fancy you'd like to enjoy again."

"September 27, 2016",20,medium food. slow kitchen. high pricing,cold sirillion steak and too much fat. took more than 30 minutes to get the steak. charging extra for ketchup for the fries. highly priced sirllion comparing to neighbouring resurants with no justification.
"September 10, 2016",50,Best burger in old town!,The service is great and the food is delicious! Totally worth the prices - we paid 40RON for a burger and it was served in under 20 minutes. I am definetely coming back here!

"May 13, 2016",50,Excellent food,"Great food, excellent services. It's very frustrating that TripAdvisor forces you to write stories in 100 characters when you only want to write about an excellent, good or bad restaurant."
"May 7, 2016",40,Nice steaks,"We were craving some meat so we decided to give this restaurant a try. All the meat we had was quite good: steak tartare, a t-bone and a fillet. The only downside were the fries. Soggy and tasteless. Service was attentive and helpful"
"April 24, 2016",40,"Good beef, high prices","Very good beef, good staf, good service. Prices are high for Romanian standards. But good meat deserves a good price. The cheapest steak good for 55 Lei (250gr.) , the average price for 250gr. is around 100 RON."
"April 23, 2016",50,Great steaks!,Chose this restaurant following previous trip advisor search and also proximity to where we were staying. Party of ten. Accommodated really well. Slightly pricey for Bucharest but overall this was value for money. Great food and good service.
"April 16, 2016",20,Way below expectations,"Live music was really good and the staff is super friendly, but the food is really mediocre.

"March 30, 2016",30,Go with Australian beef,"I went with the Australian steak, and it was by-far better than the choices of my co-workers. Pretty generic, but we just wanted steaks that night. Good beer. Nice area of Old Town. For Romania, seemed expensive."
"March 30, 2016",30,Not the best,Staff friendly but a bit pushy as noted in previous reviews. Prices definitely on the high side for bucharest. I'd definitely suggest look elsewhere for better food at better prices.
"March 1, 2016",50,Worth coming back,We visited there twice (day after day). We had starters and steakד. Was really tasty. Excellent service and reasonable prices.
"February 18, 2016",50,perfect food - perfect place !!!!,"the food was perfect and the serve in a high level.Also the decoration was modern and minimal,i would go again!"

"February 9, 2016",30,Dont go if you are in a rush.,"Absolutely amazing food, some of the best steak ever however the service was truly awful. We waited over 2 hours for one course and weren't even given a complementary drink. Having said that, slow service seems to be the way in Bucharest."
"February 1, 2016",40,Great steaks,Me and 2 colleagues had dinner here in January. We had some delicious starters and each a good steak. Perfectly cooked with good tasting sides. This is not the cheapest place in Bucharest but a must if you crave steaks

"December 25, 2015",30,Expensive and bland; foul smell inside,"The place looks very nice, but the food is pricey and disappointing. Beverages are expensive too. The non-smoker's corner smells like sewer. Will not go again for food. It could be nice for coffee and beers in the non-stinky part."
"November 26, 2015",40,Good steak and nice cake,"Nice restaurant which does what it should, namely delivering you a good slab of quality steak. My Medium was perhaps more of a medium rare - but I'm a Brit and we do like our meat incinerated! Carrot cake was surprising nice also. Worth considering."
"November 25, 2015",50,Excellent place to listen to a bit of live music,"Fine food based on veal. Live guitar music every evening. Cool setup of the place: rock/ cowboy-ish. Music a bit too loud when live. Makss it difficult to chat. I really love the place, though. Would recommend it 100%."

"August 16, 2015",30,"Fine burger, nothing special","If this were Bulgaria, I'd say this place rocks. But Romania has better options and so this was just fine. Hubby and daughter had burgers that they enjoyed. Fries were fine. Chicken wings were disappointing. Overall a bit pricy for the offering."
"July 22, 2015",50,Awesome food,"Great food, love the steak and burgers they have. Good prices for the quality and love the ambience this place offers when eating"
"July 6, 2015",30,Neither good or bad,A restaurant like you could find in any other cosmopolitan city: the strange thing is that obviously the cook could not really cook it rare... also we were sitting at the terrace and service was ok.
"May 10, 2015",50,Like,Very very good resturant.... The meat was great and the price is middle... Very clean. You have to go!
"May 7, 2015",50,Great steaks and salads,"We had a superb salad to start which we shared and then excellent steaks cooked exactly to your liking, and the staff were very attentive especially the lady manager who was very helpful."
"April 10, 2015",50,Great food,I went to Red Angus several times! Each time trying out something new! The food is great ( 10x to the Cheff) and the atmosphere is great too thanks to the guy who is playing a guitar and singing great country songs!
"March 21, 2015",40,Fantastic burgers,we visited the restaurant today and were greeted with friendly and attentive service. The burgers were well cooked and very tasty with crisp home cooked fries. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Bucharest.
